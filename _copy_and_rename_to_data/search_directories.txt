Location				Index	Monitor
# Enter paths to the folders you would like Elasticsearch to index and monitor.
# All source and text files in indexed folders will be available for searching.
# Full paths from the folders will also be collected, for linking.
# There are three fields per entry, separated by one or more tabs.
# The format is full folder path <tab(s)> Index 1 or 0 <tab(s)> Monitor 1 or 0
# Put the full path to the folder first.
# Then after tab(s) put a 1 to have the folder indexed.
# Then after more tab(s) put a 1 to have the folder monitored for changes
# or a 0 if it's a mapped (NAS) drive, they can't be monitored reliably.
# NOTE try to keep total files indexed under 500,000.
#
# Lines that start with '#' are comments, ignored.
#
# For convenience, specific subfolders can be skipped.
# To ignore (skip) a subfolder, put
# IGNORE <tab(s)> path_to_folder
# Examples, with a # and space in front:
# C:\qtprojects\project51		1	1
# Q:/qtlibs/src					1	0
# IGNORE	C:\qtprojects\project51\test
#    (project51 will be indexed and monitored,
#    however its \test subfolder will be skipped.
#    Q:/qtlibs/src will be indexed but not monitored for changes)
#
# See Documentation/Configuring folders to index and monitor.html
# if you want more details.
#
# The following line includes the IntraMine folder for indexing and monitoring.
# You can comment it out with a leading '#' if you want.
