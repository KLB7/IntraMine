Location				Index	Monitor
# See Documentation/Configuring folders to index and monitor.txt for the how-to
# if you want more details after reading the below.
# Lines that start with '#' are commented out.
# Add folders here for IntraMine to index and/or monitor.
# "Index" means index file contents with Elasticsearch, as well
# as collecting full paths for all contained source and text files.
# "Monitor" is short for monitor the folder and its contents for all changes.
# IntraMines' Search page will let you search all indexed files.
# And the full paths lists will help you create file links easily.
# Feel free to add all folders containing source or text files
# that are of interest to you up to a rough limit of 500,000 files.
# Format
# The format is full folder path <tab(s)> Index 1 or 0 <tab(s)> Monitor 1 or 0.
# A line starting with # is a comment line.
# "Index" 1 means the folder will be indexed by Elasticsearch.
# Put a 1 in the Index field for all entries.
# "Monitor" 1 means monitor the folder for changes. All locally attached
# drives should have a 1 in the Monitor field. Mapped network drives
# should have a 0 in the Monitor field since they can't be monitored reliably.
# However, you can put a 1 there if you want IntraMine to try monitoring the folder.
#
# Example entries (with "# " up front to comment them out):
# C:\My main projects\Python Projects	1	1
#   - will be indexed and monitored.
# Z:/FancyLib/src	1	0
#   - where Z is a mapped NAS drive, src will be indexed but not monitored for changes.
#
#
# The following line includes the IntraMine folder for indexing and monitoring.
# You can comment it out with a leading '#' if you want.
_INTRAMINE_				1		1
# ADD YOUR ENTRIES AFTER THIS LINE.
