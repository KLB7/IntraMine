# Using '|' to mean 'one or more tabs', the format here is:
# Count|Page Name|Unique short name|Perl program name(optional |PERSISTENT or BACKGROUND)
#
# Page servers
# ------------
# If it doesn't have BACKGROUND in the last field, it's a Page server.
# A Page server can have any number of running instances, as set in the Count field.
# If the Page Name and Unique short name are identical, the server will have an entry in
# the top navigation bar in the browser, and it will be sent broadcasts from the main server.
# Elsewhere this is called a "top level" server.
# The Unique short name is the important one internally, and is used in URLs to signal which
# server a request should be sent to. 
# A server that's not in the top nav should have its
# Page Name set to one that IS in the top nav, eg the default Page Name for Viewer below
# is Search. This isn't absolutely needed, and mainly indicates a relationship, for example
# Viewer is called by Search when search result links are clicked on. But Viewer is also
# called when files are clicked on in the Files view, so Viewer could also have been
# given a Page Name of Files. No worries, make Page Name the same as the unique Short name
# if you want the server of that name to appear in the top navigation bar, and make
# the Page Name different from the Short name if you don't want the server to
# appear in the top nav bar, though using a Page Name for a top nav server is best
# in this case. These are elsewhere called "second level" servers sometimes.
#
# BACKGROUND servers
# ------------------
# BACKGROUND servers are singletons (Count is ignored) and don't appear in the top nav bar.
# BACKGROUND Page name should be UPPERCASE (I've forgotten why, just do it please).
# BACKGROUND Short name should be unique.
# FILEWATCHER is an example, monitoring the file system for changes.
#
# PERSISTENT servers
# ------------------
# If a page server is PERSISTENT then it survives a normal stop request, and only stops when
# it is sent a FORCEEXIT. The Cmd page server takes advantage of this to stay running when all other
# page servers are stopped, so it can provide feedback until the other servers are restarted.
# (Note this is a "feature" you can safely ignore.)
#
#
# Count indicates how many of each server to start.
# Note the Status page has buttons to add, stop, start, and restart Page servers
# for the current session only. To add a Page server permanently in a way that survives a
# restart of Intramine, adjust the Count field for it here.
#
# To remove a server, comment out its line with an initial '#' or set the first Count field to 0.
