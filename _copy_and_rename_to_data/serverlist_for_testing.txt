# Servers to start and test, used when IntraMine is started with "-t" for testing.
# A zero Count means the server will not be testing. Set Count to 1 to test a server.
# The entry for Main controls whether Main will run a self-test, but Main always runs,
# and in fact it runs all the other tests - see intramine_main.pl#RunAllTests().
