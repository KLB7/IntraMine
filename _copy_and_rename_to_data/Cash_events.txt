# Cash flow, with details and a summary graph.

# Cash events file fields: any line starting with ^\s*# is a comment line, ignored.
# Fields are separated by ONE OR MORE tabs (<t> below in the description).
# Events:
# OPENING<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>(Description, ignored)				# Opening balance and month to start
# UNTIL<t>YYYYMM<t>(Description, ignored)						# Ending month, inclusive
# INCOME_ANNUAL<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>YYYYMM<t>Description			# Amount, start year and month, end year and month, applied once per year inclusive
# INCOME_MONTHLY<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>YYYYMM<t>Description			# Amount, start and end year/month, applied monthly inclusive
# EXPENSE_ANNUAL<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>YYYYMM<t>Description			# Like INCOME_ANNUAL, except amount is deducted
# EXPENSE_MONTHLY<t>amount<t>YYYYMM YYYYMM<t>Description			# Like INCOME_MONTHLY, except amount is deducted
# ASSET<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>Description							# One-shot expense, in the year/month specified

# Per cent annual increase is optional for annual and monthly income and expenses. Eg
# EXPENSE_MONTHLY	100	202107	202501	Insurance	3
# for a 3% annual increase on the monthly expense of $100.
# NOTE percentage increase will start at the event date or the OPENING
# event date, whichever is later.

# There are no explicit twice-a-year or quarterly events, but you can do those with two or four ANNUAL events.
# It's ok if the range of dates for an annual or monthly item is wider
# than the OPENING/UNTIL range - events outside that range will be ignored.
