# Cash events file fields: any line starting with ^\s*# is a comment line, ignored.
# Fields are tab-separated (<t> below in the description).
# Events:
# OPENING<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>(Description, ignored)				# Opening balance and month to start
# UNTIL<t>YYYYMM<t>(Description, ignored)						# Ending month, inclusive
# INCOME_ANNUAL<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>YYYYMM<t>Description			# Amount, start year and month, end year and month, applied once per year inclusive
# INCOME_MONTHLY<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>YYYYMM<t>Description			# Amount, start and end year/month, applied monthly inclusive
# EXPENSE_ANNUAL<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>YYYYMM<t>Description			# Like INCOME_ANNUAL, except amount is deducted

# ASSET<t>amount<t>YYYYMM<t>Description							# One-shot expense, in the year/month specified

# There are no explicit twice-a-year or quarterly events, but you can do those with two or four ANNUAL events.
# It's ok if the range of dates for an annual or monthly item is wider
# than the OPENING/UNTIL range - events outside that range will be ignored.
