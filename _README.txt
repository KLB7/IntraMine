Welcome to IntraMine
========================

You will need to do some installation to get IntraMine going. For a quick approach, open the __START_HERE_INTRAMINE_INSTALLER folder and double-click on "1 READ ME FIRST how to install IntraMine.html". You'll be guided through the installation and shown how to start, stop, and access IntraMine.

After you've started and visited IntraMine, you'll see a big '?' at the right end of the navigation bar at the top of the window: click on that to bring up IntraMine's documentation. You can also go straight to it by double-clicking on Documentation/contents.html.

Have fun!
