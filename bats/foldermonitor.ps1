# foldermonitor.ps1: signal Watcher (intramine_filewatcher.pl) whenever there is a file
# or folder change in the folders monitored by IntraMine. This is done at most once
# per second. The signal causes Watcher to check the log file created by
# the File Watcher service, which contains details on the changes. Alas, File Watcher
# doesn't report the old name for a folder when it is renamed, so this script saves
# the old and new names for a folder change to a file. When Watcher notices a folder
# rename in the File Watcher log, it reads the old name from that file.
# So this script does two things: it signals when a file change has happened, which
# cuts down file re-indexing time, and it supplies the old folder name when a folder
# is renamed.

#The advantage of this method over using WMI eventing is that this can monitor sub-folders. 
#The -Action parameter can contain any valid Powershell commands.
