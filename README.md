# IntraMine

*Fast search and real autolinking for your Windows intranet.*

NOTE as of October 13 2020 IntraMine is temporarily under maintenance, with the goal of supporting Elasticsearch 7. If you want a working version of IntraMine, please select "Watching" under the eyeball menu at top right, and then you'll be notified when IntraMine is back. I hope this will only take a week or two. Right now, Search::Elasticsearch has been updated to work with Elasticsearch 7, but IntraMine expects version 6.8, so searching just won't work.

I have left this project public for the interim, in case you want to browse through the source. And [the documentation](http://intramine.info) is still available.

Thanks for your patience - KLB7.
