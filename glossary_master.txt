This is an example of an IntraMine "glossary master" file that will be used to show glossary popups for terms in all source and text files when they are displayed by IntraMine's Viewer or Editor. You can have several "glossary_mster.txt" files in different folders if you want, just make sure they are in indexed locations and all terms in them will be picked up. To be specific, "glossary_master.txt" files must be within a directory (or contained subdirectory) listed in IntraMine's data/search_directories.txt. All definitions in all "glossary_master.txt" files will be combined into one list when presenting the popup hints.

For more on glossaries, see Documentation/Glossary definition popups.txt (or .html).

The format of entries here is the term being defined, at the start of a new line, followed by a colon, and then what follows the colon is the definition for the term. The term being defined can consist of up to four words. The definition can go on for more than one paragraph, but remember it has to fit in a "tooltip" window. If there are synonyms, you can put them all together at the start of the line, separated by commas (see for example "Autolinks" below). Entries don't have to be in alphabetical order. To see them in order, view this file using IntraMine's Viewer.

The definition part after the colon continues until the next paragraph with a colon is seen, as in the "Autolinks" example below which has three paragraphs. For this purpose, and actually everywhere in IntraMine, a paragraph ends when you press the Enter key and long lines are always wrapped to fit the window.

So, what can you put in a definition?
 - plain text
 - a single image, with file name in quotes such as the CTRL+C example below
 - text marked up with Gloss (IntraMine's Markdown variant), such as the Gloss example below.

For details see "Glossary popups.txt" and "Gloss.txt".


**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**, don't put your glossary terms in this file. Instead, create your own "glossary_master.txt" file somewhere outside your IntraMine folder, in an indexed directory as mentioned above. That way there will be no conflict when you update your IntraMine installation. If IntraMine is running when you create or save any "glossary_master.txt" file then the updated entries will be instantly available, but you'll need to refresh your browser to see the new popup glossary definitions in any Viewer window. The Editor will pick up any new glossary term popups two seconds after you stop editing, otherwise you can refresh the window.


Note if you want a backslash, use two of them in a row.

And now here are four example glossary entries. (No colon has been used up to this point, so no glossary entries have been picked up yet.)

**EXAMPLE ENTRIES**

Autolinks, automatic links, automatic linking, autolinking, FLASH link, FLASH links, FLASH linking: Briefly, IntraMine uses a complete list of paths to Elasticsearch-indexed files, and the notion of "context", which is the folder containing the file where you are mentioning some other file, to generate a hyperlink to the file without your needing to type the full path to the file, or any special characters. Though putting links in double quotes helps readability in the original text.

You can also link to headings within other files, such as "Gloss.txt#Gloss vs MultiMarkdown tables".

That was a bit brief wasn't it? Please see "Gloss.html" and "Linker.html" in IntraMine's Documentation folder for more details and some examples. And autolinking_demo.pl for a running example of the FLASH link algorithm.

Swarm server: A service written to run under IntraMine. A server is a "swarm" server if it uses "swarmserver.pm" to answer HTTP requests, and communicate with other services, including IntraMine's main service.

CTRL+C: "tenor.gif".

Gloss: IntraMine's Markdown variant, minimal memorable markup designed for intranet use. You can use it fully in text files and use autolinks in source files, as described in "Gloss.html". Gloss can also be used in glossary definitions which show in any text or source file, see "Glossary popups.html" for glossary usage.

A sample table (see "Gloss.html#Tables" for details)
TABLE Gloss support in various contexts
Feature					IntraMine Viewer, text	Viewer, source		Glossary popups		ToDo
Bold, italic, code		Yes						No					Yes					Yes
Autolinks				Yes (full support)		Yes					"Quotes needed"		"Quotes" and full path needed
Image hovers			Yes						Yes					No (inlined)		"Quotes" and full path needed
Tables					Yes						No					Yes					Yes (use tab or \t to separate cells)
Lists					Yes						No					Yes					Yes
CODE blocks				Yes						No					No					No
(A TABLE ends when there's a line with no tab.)
Quotes can be single or double, eg "Gloss.html" or 'Gloss.html'.
IntraMine's Editor fully supports autolinks and image hovers, but otherwise shows Gloss markup as typed.
You can also have
1. Numbered lists
1.2 with subitems, up to 99.99
 - bulleted lists
  -- with subitems too
**Bold**, *italic*, and *!*/* Code snippets */ int x = 42;*!*.
Images will be shown inline, eg "button1.png" "globe.gif" "favicon-32x32.png"
