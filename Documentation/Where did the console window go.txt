Where did the console window go?
================================

IntraMine has a console window when you start it, but it's minimized to the Task bar.

Feedback messages are provided on IntraMine's "Mon" page: you'll see a new instance of Mon when you start IntraMine, and Mon is always available on the top navigation bar on any IntraMine page.

If you don't want that new fresh instance of "Mon" every time you restart IntraMine, see "Mon.html" for how to turn it off.

Under routine circumstances you can forget that IntraMine has a console window, and you won't find anything interesting in it unless a service crashes. There has never been a user report of an IntraMine service crashing.
(Knock wood, ouch.)
