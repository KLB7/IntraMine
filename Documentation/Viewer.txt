What it's for
==================
The Viewer service provides HTML views of your source and text files in your browser. It kicks in when you click on a link in Search results, or the Files page, or a link in a view that you're looking at. These are all links to the Viewer, as opposed to the links on the little pencil icons (edit1.png) that follow most regular links - those invoke the Editor. Note IntraMine's Editor packs the Viewer and Editor links into one, and the Edit link is the purple part at the right end of the link( eg editorlink.png).

The Viewer is especially good at displaying .txt files that have been marked up using Gloss. For more on Gloss, see "Gloss.txt".

An attempt has been made to display views of .docx and PDF files, with indifferent results.

Viewer configuration
===================
In intramine_config.txt:
---
COMMON_IMAGES_DIR	C:/common/images/
---
If you want to use a common folder for images now and then, you can drop them in this folder and they will be available in any View where you mention the image name.

There are other config values used by the Viewer, such as
CTAGS_DIR	C:/ctags-2019-01-18_5a2b65f8-x64
but these are normally set when installing IntraMine.

PDF and docx viewers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can set your preferred PDF or docx viewer in data/intramine_config.txt.
PDF viewer: set LOCAL_OPENER_PDF around line 175
Word docx viewer: set LOCAL_OPENER_WORD_DOCX around line 176

Viewer features
===============
Syntax highlighting
-------------------
CodeMirror generates the syntax highlighting for most files. Perl file highlighting is done using the Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved module, with pod being a special case (see libs/pod2thml_intramine.pm). Markdown (.md) files are formatted using Text::MultiMarkdown. Text (.txt) files are formatted using Gloss, IntraMine's version of "markdown" as described in Gloss.txt - Gloss has true autolinking, an automatically generated table of contents, glossary popups, and many other features you might find useful, with little or no overhead to memorize.

Table of contents
-----------------
2020-03-10 23_48_40-elasticsearcher.pm.png
As mentioned above, some views have an automatically generated table of contents down the left side. A small double-headed arrow at the top of the table allows collapsing/expanding, without altering your document position. Clicking on a table entry will of course jump you to the corresponding place in the main text, and the selected entry in the table of contents will change to keep up with the heading you're currently under as you scroll through the document.

In supported source files the entries in the table of contents are alphabetically ordered, and in text files the order is the same as in the document. As an exception, the tables of contents for files named "glossary.txt" or "glossary_master.txt" are ordered alphabetically.

A click on a method or class etc name in the table of contents will normally take you to the corresponding item but with any leading comments also scrolled into view.

Autolinks
----------
The Viewer inserts the following kinds of links, with source and text file links expanded to full paths by the Linker (some file paths are made up):
TABLE Links inserted by the Viewer
Type                     					Example                     	Constraints/Overhead
Full local/NAS path		C:/Go/src/entity.go			None. Can be put in quotes.
Partial local/NAS path	src/entity.go				Must be indexed. Can be put in quotes.
File name				entity.go					Must be indexed. Can be put in quotes.
Location in file		"Gloss.txt#Links", "swarmserver.pm#MainLoop()"			Must be indexed, double quotes always work, leaving them off often works in .txt files but looks ugly.
Line in file		"Gloss.txt#87"					As for location.
Internal heading in .txt		"Image hovers"		Double quotes are required.
Internal function or class	searchSubmit(), GoogleSuggest			None.
Web						http://google.com			None. Can be quoted.
Note all link mentions can be enclosed in double quotes if desired, to improve visibility in the original text.

In Perl files, "use Module;" receives a Viewer link and a link to metacpan if it's a standard module, otherwise a Viewer link and an Editor link if it appears to be a module that you own. See the image at top of this file.

Details can be found in Gloss.txt.

Glossary popups
----------------
If you're using IntraMine to view this file, you might have noticed that some words and short phrases are underlined (for example, glossary popups), and that if you pause your cursor over them an explanation or definition will pop up. These are glossary popups. They can be made available in all source and text files, and using them can increase comprehension speed, as well as cutting the Gordian knot of using terms before they have been defined.

Glossary popups are most excellent for bringing new people up to speed, creating in-house user's guides, and even reminding yourself of tricky details.

As an example of tricky details, here's one I have in one of my own glossary_master.txt files:
---
Need escaping, needs escaping: only    .^$*+?()[{\|   need escaping in regex outside of a character class, and only   ^-]\   inside one.
---

For the details on how to make and use your own glossaries see "glossary popups.txt".

Standalone is special
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For most .txt files, links will be put in for any file specifier that matches an indexed file, and glossary entries will be taken from your collection of glossary_master.txt files. However, there are .txt files that need different handling, namely those that you are using as sources for standalone HTML files, as generated by gloss2html.pl. For those, you want to see glossary entries taken from any glossary.txt file in the same folder, and also limit links to files in the same folder, so there's a match with the resulting HTML version of the file. This happens in both the Editor and Viewer if you have a glossary.txt file in the same folder.

Image hovers
-------------
topnav.png
*Just an image to catch your attention.*

When you're using the Viewer to display .txt files you'll find a button at top right labelled "Inline Images" / "Hover Images". This toggle switches between displaying "hover links" (the default) and displaying the images fully inline. Your preference for hover/inline will be remembered on a per-file basis.

For the default of "Hover Images" the image is not displayed, but rather you'll see a link to the image bracketed by two small yellow hummingbirds. If you pause your cursor over the link, the image will pop up. Move your mouse and it goes away. And if you click on the link, the image will open in a new browser tab.

For details on creating image links, see "Gloss.txt#Images". (Spoiler, it's easy.)

Hit and selection highlighting
------------
If your view comes from clicking on a link in Search results, the words you searched for will be highlighted in the view and down the scroll bar. You can toggle the initial highlighting with the "Hide/Show Initial Hits" button at the top of the view. In CodeMirror views, only the first 100 instances will be highlighted.

If you select a word or short phrase, it will be highlighted in the text and on the scroll bar. To cancel a highlight, click on a blank line or after a non-word character.

In documents longer than about 4,000 lines you'll see a precision thumb to help with scrolling to a highlight.

*Initial hit on search word "headingAboveContents" is pink, current selected text is blue, the other instance of it is marked in green.*

Position toggle
---------------
2019-11-30 16_41_10-elasticsearcher.pm.png
Sometimes you want to jump back and forth between two widely spaced positions in a document. The "Toggle" button does that. The positions must be separated by more than a page to count as two separate locations. You can fine-tune the two positions by scrolling up or down slightly, up to roughly plus or minus a page at each end at one time.

Full Gloss on text files
------------------------
Text files (.txt) are run through a Gloss preprocessor to give you all of the above, plus really easy-to-use tables, ordered and unordered lists, horizontal rules, italic and bold, and some extra emphasis for BUG and NOTE etc. Details are in Gloss.txt.

Editor links
-------------
The how-to is described in "Editing documents.txt", but in brief any local or NAS file can have a link to the editor of your choice, as configured in data/intramine_config.txt. So you can jump over to Eclipse or notepad++ or Visual Studio Code with one click. Or use IntraMine's built-in Editor (the default) if you want to make documents that are marked up with Gloss.

Editor links appear as small pencils (edit1.png) to the right of regular links on files.

Auto-refresh
----------------
When you use any editor to save a file, any view displayed with IntraMine's Viewer will automatically refresh. This is instant if the change was made using IntraMine's Editor, and takes 1-2 seconds if the change was made with some other editor. This is especially handy for working on Markdown or Gloss files: open a file in the Viewer and any editor, then see your changes rendered immediately.

Brace matching
------------------
Click on or next to a curly brace ('{' or '}') to highlight it and its matching counterpart. (.txt, .pod, and .md do not have brace matching.)
braces.png

git diff markers
-----------------
IntraMine's Viewer and Editor will both display markers in the line number gutter and in the scrollbar if a file is in a git repository. The gutter markers will show new/changed lines with blue or gray pipes '|',  and deleted lines with red or gray triangles '▸'. 

Under the hood
==============

The Viewer is an IntraMine server, so it uses the swarmserver.pm module together with "%RequestAction" entries to handle requests from users and other servers, and JavaScript fetch() calls.

CodeMirror generates the basic views for most source files, but Perl and .txt files have their own custom views. ".txt" files are given the full Gloss treatment including a table of contents (see "Gloss.txt"), but all source and text files have links to other indexed source and text files, images in indexed folders, web pages, and headers or classes or functions in the same document. Any short text selection will be highlighted throughout the document with occurrences marked in the scroll bar. If the view is arrived at as a result of clicking on a Search hit, search words will also be highlighted similarly, in different colors. Some source files also have a synchronized table of contents (Perl, Pod, C / C++, Go, JavaScript, CSS, Clojure, Erlang, OCaml, PHP, Python, Ruby, TypeScript, Rust, Java, C#, VBScript(.vb), VB.NET(.vbs), Haskell, Julia, Fortran, COBOL) - support for other languages is planned.

Main back-end Perl files
-------------------
 - **intramine_viewer.pl** delivers the HTML for a file view (see FullFile() there). For text and Perl files, the view is mostly generated and delivered with the initial request: for CodeMirror views, just a skeleton of the page is delivered, and a "req=loadfile" fetch() retrieves the file contents, for display by CodeMirror.
 - **win_wide_filepaths.pm** is included here and in many other servers, to properly handle file names and paths that contain non-ASCII characters of the UTF-16 sort that Windows uses.

Main front-end JavaScript files
--------------------------
CodeMirror-based views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - **cmViewerStart.js** starts things going by setting up a CodeMirror instance, and loading the file with loadFileIntoCodeMirror().
 - **codemirror.js** and other CodeMirror JavaScript files are included
 - **cmAutoLinks.js** calls the back-end intramine_linker.pl#CmLinks() to put file and other links on any text seen for the first time. For CodeMirror, the links are done using an overlay layer.
 - **tooltip.js** handles "image hovers", showing the image when the cursor stops over a link to an image.


Other (non-CodeMirror) source and text views
~~~~~~~~~~~
 - **viewerStart.js** handles a few little things to get a view started, such as resizing the main text element, but it's mainly concerned with managing highlights in the text and on the scrollbar for selected text, and for any initial highlights representing words that were searched for, if we arrive at the view from Search results.
 - **autoLink.js** calls back to intramine_viewer.pl#NonCmLinks() to insert file and other links directly into the displayed HTML when text is seen for the first time.
 - **tooltip.js** is also used for these views to handle "image hovers".


Request Actions
----------------
The %RequestAction hash near the top of intramine_viewer.pl associates callbacks with patterns in incoming http requests.

For example:
 - "$RequestAction{'href'} = \&FullFile;" means call FullFile() if the URL contains the argument "href=path to a file". A web page is returned.
 - "$RequestAction{'req|loadfile'} = \&LoadTheFile;" will call LoadTheFile() if the request contains "req=loadfile", with additional arguments containing the path to the file etc. This is called for CodeMirror views to load the text into CodeMirror, and returns the full plain text of the file.

Server start and finish
-----------------------
1. Typically a Viewer (intramine_viewer.pl) is started in IntraMine's Main server by intramine_main.pl#StartServerSwarm(), which passes a Page name, Short name, main port, and assigned listening port to the Viewer instance. A typical command line:
 -- perl C:/...path.../intramine_viewer.pl Search Viewer 81 43126
2. Some initialization sets up a log file, prepares the ctags processor etc.
3. swarmserver.pm#MainLoop() is called, with a reference to the %RequestAction hash.
4. MainLoop() continues until the server is terminated, preferably with a polite "EXITEXITEXIT" request rather than a CTRL-C.

View load sequence
------------------
1. Browser receives request for a file view, eg 'http://localhost:81/Viewer/?href=C:/...path.../docs/notes.txt&searchItems=words+searched+for&rddm=22044/', where
 -- "href" holds the path to the file
 -- "searchItems" is optional, holding words searched for if the link was in Search hits
 -- "rddm" is probably useless, but I've left it in.
2. The Main server redirects the request to an instance of the Viewer, eg port 43126.
3. Request is received by swarmserver.pm#MainLoop(): "$RequestAction{'href'} = \&FullFile;" is registered as the "href" handler in intramine_viewer.pl, so FullFile() is called, with URL arguments passed along in the "$formH" hash, eg $formH->{'href'} = "C:/...path.../docs/notes.txt"
4. FullFile() returns HTML with CSS and JavaScript appropriate for the file, through a call to intramine_viewer.pl#GetContentBasedOnExtension(). The Viewer has separate handling for HTML, images, PDF, Word, Perl, pod, text, markdown, go, all other languages supported by CodeMirror with ctags (.cpp .js etc), and finally those supported by CodeMirror but not ctags (eg .textile). 
4.1 For views handled by CodeMirror, the file contents are requested after loading by cmViewerStart.js#loadFileIntoCodeMirror().
4.2 For views not handled by CodeMirror, FullFile() returns the entire file contents in the HTML response.
5. After "loading complete" in the browser, addAutoLinks() is called to turn all source and text file mentions into links. For CodeMirror-based views, cmViewerStart.js#loadFileIntoCodeMirror() calls cmAutoLinks.js#addAutoLinks() after the text has loaded. For non-CodeMirror views (.txt .pl and a few others), viewerStart.js#reJumpAndHighlight() calls autoLinks.js#addAutoLinks() on the browser's "load" event. For details on how and when autolinks are loaded, see "Linker.txt#Autolink sequence".

Gloss processing
---------------
Full Gloss processing is applied only to text files, by intramine_viewer.pl#GetPrettyTextContents(). File and web links are added after loading for all files including text files, as described in "Linker.txt#Autolink sequence".

Gloss processing happens in several passes through the text:
 - table of contents generation, either during other processing (.txt etc, see eg intramine_viewer.pl#GetPrettyTextContents()) or separately by calling universal ctags (.go etc, see intramine_viewer.pl#GetCTagsTOCForFile())
 - emphasis (bold, italic), ordered/unordered lists, horizontal rules, headings, and Perl module mentions
 - TABLE handling (.txt only)  - see intramine_viewer.pl#PutTablesInText()
 - internal links, referencing headings in the current document.
 - external links (autolinks) are added after the view is loaded to the browser window, see Linker.txt for details.

Non-text files receive limited Gloss processing, mainly autolinks for source, text, image, and web mentions. And views for supported languages (see above) receive a table of contents, and links on names of functions and classes defined in the file.
