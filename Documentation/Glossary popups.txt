Glossary popups
================

IntraMine has two different glossaries: one called "glossary.txt" for use when generating standalone HTML documents with gloss2html.pl, and another called "glossary_master.txt" for use with all source and text files displayed by IntraMine's Viewer or Editor.

You can have several glossary_master.txt files. They will all be combined when displaying definition popups.

For details on using a "glossary.txt" file to provide glossary entries for standalone HTML files, please see "gloss2html.pl for standalone Gloss files.txt".

Here we'll focus on using "glossary_master.txt" files to provide universal glossary entries, available in all your source and text files provided the glossary_master.txt files are in indexed locations.

Why bother with a glossary? It's true that not all projects need one. But if it's more than just you involved, in particular if you have other developers working with you (especially ones new to the project) or if you have a manager or two, or if you have customers, or prospective investors, then instantly available definitions and procedure descriptions can help others understand your work.

For an opinion from an experienced developer on whether or not you need a glossary, see

In brief: "...there is no excuse for the absence of a glossary in any software project."

With that out of the way, let's make and use a master glossary.

Making and using a master glossary
===========================

Making
------------
1. First, get IntraMine up and running, as described in IntraMine's Documentation folder. Double-click on Documentation/contents.html to get started with that, you'll see installation instructions at the top.
2. Take a look at the included example master glossary, "glossary_master.txt" included at the top of your IntraMine folder. It describes the whole glossary process and includes four example glossary entries.
3. Make a new file called "glossary_master.txt" in any indexed folder (or contained subfolder). Your indexed folders are listed in IntraMine's data/search_directories.txt file. (Avoid the IntraMine folder though, to prevent conflicts when you next update IntraMine.)
4. Start putting glossary entries in your new file, using the format described in the the included master glossary (glossary_master.txt at the top of your IntraMine folder), or as described in "Glossary entry details" below. The simplest form of an entry is the term to define followed by a colon ":" and then the definition of the term. The definition can use Gloss, as described below.
5. Save your new glossary_master.txt file after you have an entry or two.
6. Using IntraMine (either the Search or Files page), open a source or text file that mentions one of your new glossary terms. There must be one somewhere, otherwise you wouldn't need a glossary, right? If that's tedious, use IntraMine's Search page to search for a term you just defined.
7. Look for the term and you'll see it has a dotted underline. Here's an example term so you can see what it will look like: swarm server. Hover your cursor over the term, and the definition will pop up in a "tooltip" style box. Move your cursor away, and the tooltip goes away.
8. When you save new entries in a glossary_master.txt file, they will be available after about five seconds. However, you'll need to refresh any Viewer or Editor display of a file to see the new entries.

Using
-----------
When viewing a file using IntraMine's Editor or Viewer, terms in your text that have glossary entries will be shown with a subdued dotted underline. Pause your cursor over the term to view its glossary popup.

After a glossary popup is showing, you can move your cursor over the content of the popup. There you can click on a link or select and copy text.

Glossary entry details
=========================

Format
-----------
Summary: up to four words per term, separate any number of multiple synonymous terms with commas, follow with a colon and then the definition.

Here's an example:
---
Regular expression, regex, regexp: a write-only way to match strings, or not.
---

Content
-----------------
The definition part of an entry can be plain text, text styled with Gloss, or a single image specifier in "quotes". As far as Gloss, basically everything except CODE blocks can be used in a glossary entry, as described in "Gloss.txt". Source and text and image file specifiers must be in "quotes", such as "project51/main.cpp" or "image27.png". FLASH linking for directory specifiers is also supported, and these again need to be in "quotes". If you don't like double quotes, you can use 'single quotes' instead.

Images in glossary entries are **displayed fully in place (inline)** rather than popping up if you hover over a link, so try to avoid huge images in your definition. This is being done mainly because images in definitions are important enough to show immediately, and also because a popup in a popup is probably one popup too far. If the image is too large when displayed, you will get scroll bars.

Comment lines
-------------------
If you want a **comment line** that won't appear in the glossary definition, start the line with '##' (exactly two #'s) and then after that put anything you want, even a colon. A comment line can appear within or between definitions. For example,
##This would be a comment line: not part of a definition.

An example
------------------
An example of a definition with some synonyms:
===
Autolinks, automatic links, automatic linking, FLASH link, FLASH links, FLASH linking: Briefly, IntraMine uses a complete list of paths to Elasticsearch-indexed files, and the notion of "context", which is the folder containing the file where you are mentioning some other file, to generate a hyperlink to the file without your needing to type the full path to the file, or any special characters. Though putting links in double quotes helps readability in the original text.

You can also link to headings within other files, such as "Gloss.txt#Gloss vs MultiMarkdown tables".

That was a bit brief wasn't it? Please see Gloss.txt and Linker.txt in IntraMine's Documentation folder for more details and some examples. And autolinking_demo.pl for an example of the FLASH link algorithm.
===
(Notice that ':' was carefully avoided after the one in the first paragraph, so the definition is three paragraphs long.)

Images on their own
--------------------
If you want to use just an image for the definition that will pop up, put the image name in quotes. For example (using <q> to stand for a quote):
---
CTRL+C: <q>tenor.gif<q>.
---

Multiple paragraphs
----------------------
Any definition continues down to (but not including) the next paragraph containing a colon. This means you can have multiple paragraphs in a definition, provided you avoid using a colon in any of the additional paragraphs beyond the first. Keep in mind though that the whole glossary entry has to fit in a tooltip so briefer is better.

A fancy example
-------------------
Here's a picture of a more elaborate "glossed" definition, from IntraMine's supplied glossary_master.txt file. As for any other glossary definition, if you have "Gloss" (or "gloss") in a document and you're using IntraMine to view it, the word will have a dotted underline and the definition below will pop up in a tooltip window if you hover your cursor over "gloss". Note it's different from the definition that pops up here for Gloss, the one here is defined in Documentation/glossary.txt and applies only to documents in the Documentation folder. The one shown below will appear in all source and text files when viewed with IntraMine.

Standalone is special
---------------------
For most .txt files, links will be put in for any file specifier that matches an indexed file, and glossary entries will be taken from your collection of glossary_master.txt files. However, there are .txt files that need different handling, namely those that you are using as sources for standalone HTML files, as generated by gloss2html.pl. For those, you want to see glossary entries taken from any glossary.txt file in the same folder, and also limit links to files in the same folder, so there's a match with the resulting HTML version of the file. This happens in both the Editor and Viewer if you have a glossary.txt file in the same folder.
