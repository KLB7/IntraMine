Installing Elasticsearch
========================

About Java
===========

IntraMine uses Elasticsearch to index source and text files. Elasticsearch is Java based, but comes with its own version of Java. However, this internal version is used only if you don't already have a Java JDK installed. If you do have one installed, Elasticsearch will use it - but it must be version 11 or higher. So, if you don't have a Java JDK installed, no worries. And if you do, make sure it's JDK 11 or higher. You can see your Java version in the JAVA_HOME system environment variable.

If you fall in the "gray" area, where you have an older Java JDK installed and would like to upgrade, you could try
https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html (the Windows x64 release). Or you could try oracle.com directly if you're brave - I couldn't see immediately how to get a working free Java JDK for Windows, but you're probably smarter than I am.

If you do use your own copy of the JDK, check that your JAVA_HOME system environment variable is set to point to a version of the JDK that's at least 11, otherwise Elasticsearch won't work. Well, I beat that to death.

[ To get to system variables: Control Panel -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables.
Or
Settings -> System -> About -> System Info (at top right) -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables.

Elasticsearch installation
==========================

If you already have Elasticsearch
---------------------------------
If you installed IntraMine, and with it Elasticsearch, before October 2020 then you are using the older 6.8.0 version of Elasticsearch. That's fine, IntraMine is still compatible with 6.8.0. The only limitation is that you should not upgrade your version of the Search::Elasticsearch module. If you decide you'd rather keep up with the latest, then you will need to:
 - remove your current version of Elasticsearch (see just below)
 - install version 7.9.2 of Elasticsearch, as described in "Getting Elasticsearch" below
 - update your Search::Elasticsearch Perl module, at a command prompt with
 ---
cpan Search::Elasticsearch
---
 - and rebuild your Elasticsearch index, as described in "Build your Elasticsearch index and run IntraMine.txt". To save you re-reading that, at a command prompt (using Run as administrator) run bats/IM_INIT_INDEX.bat, and then go away for an hour or two.

To remove your current version of Elasticsearch, run these two commands at a command prompt:
(change the "6.8.0" if your old version isn't 6.8.0).
C:\elasticsearch-6.8.0\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat stop
C:\elasticsearch-6.8.0\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat remove

Getting Elasticsearch
----------------------
Currently I'm recommending version Elasticsearch 7.9.2, which is compatible with the latest version of the Search::Elasticsearch module.

To download Elasticsearch version 7.9.2, head to
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-9-2
On the resulting page, click on "WINDOWS" near the top to start your download. You'll be downloading a file called "elasticsearch-7.9.2-windows-x86_64.zip".

Unzip it somewhere. Look inside, and verify that you see "bin", "config", and "lib" folders, among others at the top. If you just see a single subfolder with roughly the same name as the top folder, such as "elasticsearch-7.9.2", then that's the one to copy, rather than the top folder.

Copy that folder to the top of your C: drive, ending up with "C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2". And just to be sure, verify that you see "bin", "config", and "lib" folders at the top level in that folder.

If you can't put the "elasticsearch-7.9.2" at the top of your C: drive, you can still do this, but note where you have placed your Elasticsearch folder and substitute your location for "C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2" below for the rest of the install. IntraMine's config files won't be affected if you put Elasticsearch somewhere else.

Add the needed tokenizer
------------------------
At a command prompt run
---
C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2\bin\elasticsearch-plugin.bat install analysis-icu
---
to install the needed special tokenizer (it helps with unicode).

Install and start Elasticsearch
-------------------------------
Install and start Elasticsearch at a command prompt with
---
C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat install
---
followed by
---
C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat start
---

Then run
---
C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat manager
---
and under the General tab in the resulting dialog window set the "Startup type" to "Automatic", Apply and OK.

Verify
------
To verify things went well, go to
http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health/?pretty
and you should see "status" : "green" near the top of the result.

Elasticsearch service management
========================
Here are some simple commands to manage Elasticsearch, again using the "7.9.2" version as an example:
C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat install
C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat start
C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat stop
C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat remove
C:\elasticsearch-7.9.2\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat manager
("manager" is mainly useful for setting the startup type to Automatic.)

To check in on Elasticsearch:
http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health/?pretty
gives a simple overview.

Once you have built an index for IntraMine, you can check it with
http://localhost:9200/intramine/_stats/?pretty

http://localhost:9200/_cat/health?v
will give you a one-line summary of Elasticsearch health.

Onwards
========
Elasticsearch is now ready for use. Just a few more steps (including building your first Elasticsearch index) and then you can fire up IntraMine.

If you are just upgrading Elasticsearch to version 7.9.2, you can skip along to rebuilding your Elasticsearch index, as shown in "Build your Elasticsearch index and run IntraMine.txt".
