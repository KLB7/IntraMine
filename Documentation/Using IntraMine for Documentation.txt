Using IntraMine for Documentation
==============================
Here you will find a brief on how to use IntraMine to produce useful documentation. The *very* short version is: use Gloss to mark up your .txt files

1. Install IntraMine and get it up and running (go through "IntraMine initial install.txt" and following install docs in the documentation for IntraMine)
2. Read up a bit on Gloss, IntraMine's markdown variant (see "Gloss.txt")
3. Create a new folder to hold your documentation if you don't have one yet
4. Use ".txt" as the extension for docs you create
5. Create a "glossary.txt" file or "glossary_master.txt" file:
5.1 If people will be accessing your docs using IntraMine, name your glossary file "glossary_master.txt" and place it in any folder that you've listed in your data/search_directories.txt file
5.2 If you will be converting your docs to standalone HTML using gloss2html.pl, name your glossary "glossary.txt" and put it in your documentation folder
6. Use FLASH links to refer to other documents as needed (see "Gloss.txt#Links")
7. Give others access to your documents
7.1 If you want people to access your docs using IntraMine, the easiest way is to let them have access to your running instance of IntraMine by providing them with a URL
7.2 If your audience doesn't have access to your instance of IntraMine and can't run it on their own PC, then convert your source .txt docs to .html using gloss2html.pl (at the top level of your IntraMine folder) and then distribute the results: you can put the results on a server, or zip them up and email them etc.
