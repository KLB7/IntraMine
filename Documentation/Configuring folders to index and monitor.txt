Configuring folders to index and monitor
========================================

The list of directories that you put in **data/search_directories.txt** will be used to tell Elasticsearch which directories to index, and also to create an XML config file for the File Watcher service that tells it which directories to monitor for changes, so that the changed files can be re-indexed. Specific subfolders can also be ignored (skipped) for indexing and monitoring.

Open up your data/search_directories.txt and let's get to it.

search_directories.txt fields
=============================
Each directory entry in data/search_directories.txt has three fields, separated by one or more tabs:
---
**Location**: IntraMine can index files in directories on NAS, but can't monitor them for changes. You *can* index NAS directories, but changes won't be picked up, so searches will be out of date. Any directory on local attached storage (SATA, USB plugged directly into your IntraMine box) can be both indexed and monitored.

**Index**: set the Index field to 1 for folders that you want to index. For the first run, all entries should be set to 1. Later, if you want to add a folder without losing your current index, Index should be set to 0 for all folders except the new entry. For more about maintaining your search index, see "Indexing additional files.txt".

**Monitor**: set the Monitor field to 1 for all local storage, and set it to 0 for all NAS (network attached storage).
---

Full paths are not case sensitive, and can use forward or back slashes (/ or \). A trailing slash is optional.

IGNORE subfolders
================
For convenience, specific subfolders can be skipped.
To ignore (skip) a subfolder, put
IGNORE <tab(s)> path_to_folder
An example, with tabs in between fields:
---
C:\qtprojects\project51		1	1
IGNORE	C:\qtprojects\project51\test
ignore	C:\qtprojects\project51\logs/
---
project51 will be indexed and monitored,
however its \test and \logs subfolders will be skipped for both indexing and monitoring.

NAS locations
==============
To specify a NAS directory as a Location:
1. First share it, of course
2. Note the \\host-name\share-name of the directory you want to share
3. Use "Map network drive" to map it to a drive letter on your IntraMine box
4. And then use the drive letter with a colon (eg "H:") as the Location.

Unfortunately, File Watcher cannot easily or reliably monitor network attached storage (NAS) directories for changes. You *can* index NAS directories, but changes won't be picked up, so searches will be out of date. For NAS directories, set the "Index" field to 1, and the "Monitor" field to 0.

Any directory on locally attached storage (drives plugged directly into your IntraMine box) can be indexed and monitored. For directories on locally attached drives, set both "Index" and "Monitor" to 1.

Enter your directories and drives
=================================
Enter the path to the directory, and then a 1 or 0 under the Index and Monitor columns, separating the three fields with one or more tabs. Forward slashes or backslashes can be used. Directory paths should not be enclosed in quotes. And no trailing slash please on the path.

So, with your list in hand, put in the paths of all the directories containing source or text files that you'll be interested in searching. Here's my personal list, as an example (H: is a "NAS" location mapped to a shared folder on a different PC):
---
Location				Index	Monitor
_INTRAMINE_				1		1
C:/perlprogs			1		1
C:/Personal				1		1
C:/Projects				1		1
C:/Common				1		1
C:/Strawberry			1		1
P:/Qt					1		1
C:/Go					1		1
H:						1		0
---

Reminder, put a 1 in the Index column for all directories, and a 1 in the Monitor column for all directories on locally attached storage, with a 0 for NAS locations. That's what you see in the example above ("H:" is a shared folder on another PC in my setup).

Folders and files not indexed
===============================
By default, IntraMine will not index:
 - files in folders where the folder name starts with a period ".", eg ".git"
 - files in /temp/ or /junk/ folders
 - .log, .out files
 - files with an unknown extension ($textExtensions in libs/ext.pm lists the 225 extensions known to IntraMine).

In theory IntraMine could index extensionless files, if "ES_INDEX_NO_EXTENSION" is set to 1 in data/intramine_config.txt. However, this is untested, so don't do that unless you are prepared to curse and revert.

Adding a directory
==================
After running IntraMine for a bit, you might want to add a directory or two and not have to completely rebuild your Elasticsearch index (which can take some time). To do that, see "Indexing additional files.txt".

You might prefer to just do a complete reindex instead, since it doesn't take that long. To do that, see "Reindex.html".

Why the Index and Monitor fields?
=================================
There are situations where changing the 0's an 1's can be useful:
 - if you want to add a folder later, you can set all of the Index entries to 0 except for the folder you're adding, and run IM_ADD_INDEX.bat to add the files in the new folder to your Elasticsearch index without deleting your current index. Set Monitor for the new folder as above, to 1 if it's locally attached, 0 if it's a NAS location. For the whole description of adding a directory, see "Indexing additional files.txt".
 - if a directory on a local drive, eg "C:\boost" contains files that will not change, you can set Monitor to 0 for it, and not bother monitoring for changes.

Where are you?
==============
If you arrived here from "Build your Elasticsearch index and run IntraMine.txt" please head back there and continue setting stuff up.
