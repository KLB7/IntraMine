Mon
=====

Click on "Mon" at the right end of any IntraMine navigation bar to see a list of messages that IntraMine has generated since it last started.

By default, a fresh instance of the Mon page will be shown using your default browser whenever you start IntraMine. You can turn that off, see below.

Mon is available on the navigation bar from any computer on your intranet. Of course, to access IntraMine remotely you do need to know the IP address of the PC running IntraMine. You can, as you know I'm sure, determine that by using "ipconfig /all" on the IntraMine PC, and the Mon page that appears on the IntraMine PC when it starts lists the IP address during startup as
---
Main Server IP: 192.168.40.8
---
for example (yours will no doubt be different).

A new Mon page at startup
========================
By default, when IntraMine starts it will show a new Mon page in a fresh browser tab, using your default browser. If you grow tired of that and don't want it any more:
---
Visit your IntraMine folder, open **data/intramine_config_8.txt**
and change 1 in the line
SHOWMONPAGEATSTARTUP	1
to a 0 and save.
---
Then when you restart you'll no longer see a fresh Mon page.
However, Mon will still be listed in the top navigation bar on any IntraMine page, and when you click on it you'll see a full list of messages from IntraMine since the last start.

Adding Mon feedback to your service
==========================
If you have based your service on swarmserver by putting
use swarmserver;
at the top of your Perl program then you can call Monitor, eg
Monitor("message\n");
to provide feedback on the Mon page.
For an example of using Monitor (and using swarmserver) see intramine_linker.pl.


Why Mon?
============
Mon is mainly a workaround. Since inception, IntraMine has used a console window to provide feedback, but this approach has always been plagued by intermittent newline corruption. Mon doesn't suffer from that, and as a bonus it allows a moderate amount of embedded HTML (links, <pre>, <strong> etc).
