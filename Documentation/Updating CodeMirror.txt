Updating CodeMirror
===================

IntraMine ships with a copy of CodeMirror (version 5.65.2) which has no known problems. Updating IntraMine's version of CodeMirror is, alas, **not possible** without an extraordinary amount of work, in fact I haven't determined how it could be done. If you know of something in a later version of CodeMirror 5 that you would like to see in IntraMine, drop me a line (klb42@proton.me) and I'll update IntraMine to ship with that newer version (unless something has broken).
