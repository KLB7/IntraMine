Read Me First
=============

You will need to do some installation to get IntraMine going. For a quick approach, open the __START_HERE_INTRAMINE_INSTALLER folder and double-click on "1 READ ME FIRST how to install IntraMine.html". You'll be guided through the installation and shown how to start, stop, and access IntraMine.

After you've started and visited IntraMine, you'll see a big '?' at the right end of the navigation bar at the top of the window: click on that to bring up IntraMine's documentation. You can also go straight to it by double-clicking on Documentation/contents.html.

After installing IntraMine you might want to browse through the **INTRAMINE IMPORTANT BITS** section listed in "contents.html", especially if you want to use FLASH links or glossary popups in your work.
