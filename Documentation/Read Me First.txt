Read Me First
=============

IntraMine's documentation in the aptly named Documentation/ folder comes in .txt and .html formats. The .html versions are much nicer to read, with formatting and file links and images, glossary popups, tables of contents and other niceties.

Start by opening "contents.html" in your browser, and all the links there will bring up .html versions. The "INSTALLING AND RUNNING INTRAMINE" section at the top of contents.html will guide you through installing IntraMine. Begin with "IntraMine initial install.html" and you'll be up and running in no time!

After installing IntraMine you might want to browse through the "INTRAMINE IMPORTANT BITS" section listed in "contents.html", especially if you want to use FLASH links or glossary popups in your work.
