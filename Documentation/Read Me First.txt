Read Me First
=============

IntraMine's documentation in the aptly named Documentation/ folder comes in .txt and .html formats. The .html versions are much nicer to read, with formatting and file links and images.

Start by opening "Documentation/contents.html" in your browser, and all the links there will bring up .html versions. The "INSTALLING AND RUNNING INTRAMINE" section at the top of contents.html is a good place to start.

IntraMine itself can be found at

Enjoy!
