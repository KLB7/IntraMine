FILEWATCHER
============
FILEWATCHER is a "background" server that listens for file system changes and sends off notifications when changes happen.

Main files
===========
Main Perl file: intramine_filewatcher.pl
Main JavaScript file: well none, actually. This "background" server does not display a web page, and does all its work in Perl.

How it works
============
FILEWATCHER detects file system changes in two ways:
 - checks the File Watcher service log for anything new
 - launches a Powershell script (foldermonitor.ps1) that monitors file system changes, and responds to any "signal=FILESYSTEMCHANGE" messages from it.

On detecting a file system change, FILEWATCHER
 - loads details of the changes from the File Watcher service log
 - uses the details to ask Elasticsearch to index affected files
 - saves a list of any new file paths
 - broadcasts a 'signal=reindex' to all IntraMine servers. This is picked up by the Viewer, which updates its full and partial path lists for FLASH links
 - broadcasts 'signal=filechange' to all IntraMine servers: the Status server in particular will respond by reloading its displayed list of recent file changes.

File consolidation
==================
FILEWATCHER keeps two full paths lists, the current consolidated list and a list of all new full paths that have come along since the last consolidation. Consolidation into a single file takes place in the wee hours of the morning, and typically takes no more than a few seconds. intramine_filewatcher.pl#PeriodicallyConsolidate() decides if it's a good time to do it, and if so calls reverse_filepaths.pm#ConsolidateFullPathLists(). Since reverse_filepaths.pm keeps all paths in memory, consolidation consists of replacing the existing consolidated file with the list in memory, and then deleting the file holding new full paths.

Configuring file consolidation
------------------------------
You'll find this in data/intramine_config.txt around line 133:
---
# For FILEWATCHER, the local start and end times for when
# path consolidation is allowed. Default 3 AM to 5 AM.
# Allow a window of at least two hours.
FILEWATCHER_CONSOLIDATION_START_HOUR	3
FILEWATCHER_CONSOLIDATION_END_HOUR		5
---
Default configuration happens just after 3 AM in the early morning, on a daily basis. If you don't run IntraMine overnight and do want indexing to stay up to date, you should change the START and END hours there (0..23) to match a time when IntraMine is running but won't be too busy. The "busy" part isn't a big deal, since consolidation is typically quick.

API
=====
FILEWATCHER checks the File Watcher service log every thirty seconds, but also responds to a signal from foldermonitor.ps1, which picks up file changes every couple of seconds when they happen

Respond to signal that the file system has changed
--------------------------------------------
**Action**: handle a file system changed signal, by rebuilding the full path list, having Elasticsearch index the changes, and signalling if new files have been added or a folder has been renamed
**Request**: /?signal=FILESYSTEMCHANGE
**Response**: none
**For example**: /?signal=FILESYSTEMCHANGE&name=Watcher
(as sent by foldermonitor.ps1. "name" is ignored.)
**See also**: bats\foldermonitor.ps1, intramine_filewatcher.pl#OnChangeDelayedIndexChangedFiles(), the actual work is done by intramine_filewatcher.pl#IndexChangedFiles()
