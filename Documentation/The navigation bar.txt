The navigation bar
===================

IntraMine puts a top navigation bar on each page, listing top-level page services. A service is top-level if its Page name and Short name are the same, and it's not a BACKGROUND service (see the table just below).

All enabled top-level servers will be listed in the navigation bar, in the order that they appear in data/serverlist.txt.

On the far right end of the navigation bar is a question mark that brings up IntraMine help when clicked. You probably knew that, since this file is part of the help.
