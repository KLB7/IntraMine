EM
===========
The "EM" service supplies an "Extract Method" refactor for Perl code. "Extract Method" is the generic name for this refactor: for Perl, it can extract a method or a sub.

Running the EM service
======================
In your data/serverlist.txt file, put the line
1	EM					EM			intramine_EM.pl

Using the EM service
=====================
You'll see instructions at the top of the web page when you switch to the "EM" tab:
---
1. Copy some Perl code that you want to turn into a separate sub.
2. Paste your code in the box just below.
3. Set how parameters should be passed and new sub name in the dialog that appears.
4. Click the "Extract" button.
5. Copy your new sub or example call from the results at bottom.

What EM does
==============
When you paste your code, missing variable declarations are detected. Those variables will be shown to you in a dialog, with the options of setting the parameters to be passed by value, by reference, or omitted (if the variable is declared in a wider scope).

After you click the "Extract" button, your new sub or method will be shown in the bottom text area, with an example call just above it in a separate text area.

From there, you can copy the resulting code in the usual way (click in a text area, CTRL+A to select all, CTRL+C to copy).

If you change your mind about how a parameter should be passed, fix it up in the dialog and click "Extract" again - there's no need to completely start over. However, if you do want to start over then hitting your browser's Refresh button is the easiest way.

Two things to watch out for
==============
The Perl code you paste should be copied from a file that passes a Perl syntax check, otherwise the generated code will probably be garbage.

And if you want something returned from your new sub you'll most likely have to touch up the code a bit after it's extracted since EM won't add a "return" for you.
