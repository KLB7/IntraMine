Chat
===========

Chat.png

IntraMine comes with a chat service, but it's not enabled by default. To enable it, paste the following line
---
1	Chat				Chat		intramine_chat.pl
---
at the bottom of your data/serverlist.txt file, restart IntraMine, and refresh any IntraMine browser window.
"Chat" will appear in IntraMine's navigation bar.

The chat service uses IntraMine's WebSockets service (run by intramine_websockets.pl) to send and receive messages.

How to Chat
==================
The (nick) name is optional, and if left blank your LAN IP address will be used instead to identify you.

At most 50 messages will be remembered and displayed.

When you click Send, anyone using IntraMine will see the "Chat" item in the navigation bar flash rapidly a few times. And anyone viewing the Chat page will see the new message immediately.

Nothing special needs to be done to refresh the Chat messages, if you're looking at the Chat page then you're seeing the latest messages as they happen.

Sorting the messages by "Newest first" is I think what most people want in a list of chat messages, but you can switch to "Oldest first" if you're coming in late to a conversation and want to view it in a sequence that's more readable.

No frills are supported in the messages, just plain text.
