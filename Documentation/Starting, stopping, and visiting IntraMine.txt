Starting, stopping, and visiting IntraMine
===============================

Stop and start
==============
To **stop IntraMine**, double-click on **bats\STOP_INTRAMINE.bat** as found in your IntraMine folder. Try not to use CTRL+C, it will rudely stop all servers. STOP_INTRAMINE.bat sends a polite request to all servers, and they will wrap up whatever they're doing before quitting.

And later you can **start IntraMine** by double-clicking **bats\START_INTRAMINE.bat** in your IntraMine folder.

Do come back to the docs and read "Using IntraMine.txt" at least, when the initial thrill wears off:)

Start/stop shortcuts
====================
To make a shortcut to START_INTRAMINE.bat (or STOP_INTRAMINE.bat), hold down the Shift and Ctrl keys and drag it to your desktop, or wherever you want the shortcut.


Visit IntraMine
===============
Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:81/Search  - use your own main port number if you changed it from 81, and if you're not on your IntraMine box, substitute its LAN IP address for 127.0.0.1 in the URI above. (As I'm sure you know, type "ipconfig /all" at a command prompt on your IntraMine box to see the LAN IP).

By default when IntraMine starts it will open a new tab called 'Mon' using your default browser. From there you can visit other IntraMine services such as Search or File using the navigation bar at the top of the page. There are also links to other pages in the text of the Mon page.


Next: If you're installing, Upgrading to Windows 11.txt.
