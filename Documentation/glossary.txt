This is an example of a glossary that can accompany a set of standalone HTML files generated by IntraMine's gloss2html.pl. It should be called "glossary.txt" and be in the same folder as the documents that hold related text files that will be converted to HTML, at the top level. The glossary is used to generate "tooltip" explanations in standalone Gloss files wherever terms in the glossary are mentioned, as generated by gloss2html.pl. Entries are not in order.

For more details, see "Documentation/gloss2html.pl for standalone Gloss files.txt".

Format is the term being defined, at the start of a new line, followed by optional synonyms separated by commas, followed by a colon. What follows the colon is the definition for the term. The term being defined can have up to four words, as can the synonyms. The definition can go on for more than one paragraph, but remember it has to fit in a "tooltip" window or there will be scroll bars. The definition ends when a paragraph containing a colon is seen. Definitions can use most of Gloss, IntraMine's Markdown variant, more about that in "Glossary popups.txt".

This top part doesn't interfere with definitions, because is carefully does not contain a colon.

Note if you want a backslash, it's best to use two of them in a row. But single backslashes usually work too.

Swarm server: A service written to run under IntraMine. A server is a "swarm" server if it uses "swarmserver.pm" to answer HTTP requests, and communicate with other services, including IntraMine's main service. There's more in "Writing your own IntraMine server.html".

Main server: IntraMine's round-robin redirect server, intramine_main.pl. The Main server redirects requests to appropriate swarm servers, based on the Short name in the request, and can receive these requests directly or from a swarm server that can't handle a request. Main also handles requests to broadcast a signal to other IntraMine servers, by name or port or general type.

Short name: The unique name for an IntraMine service, as found in data/serverlist.txt. Each service should have its own unique name in the "Short name" column there.

Page name: This is set in the "Page name" column of data/serverlist.txt, and serves two purposes: it provides the name to display for the service in IntraMine's top navigation bar for top-level services, and it can be shared by several services to indicate that they are somehow associated - signals can be sent to all services that share the same Page name, for example.

Top level: A service is "top level" and has an entry in the top navigation bar if its Page name and Short name are the same in data/serverlist.txt, and it's not marked there as a "BACKGROUND" service. A top level service will show up in IntraMine's top navigation bar.

The number of instances of a top level service to run is set by its "Count" field in data/serverlist.txt.

A top-level service can have second level services that it hands off to for specific tasks. For example, the Search page presents a list of hits with file links, and hands off to either the Viewer or Editor service when a link is clicked. The Viewer and Editor services are also called in response to clicks on the Files page links.

Second level: A second level service is called by a top level service to fulfill a specific need, such as viewing or editing a file. It has no entry in the navigation bar.

The number of instances of a second level service to run is set by its "Count" field in data/serverlist.txt.

Page service, page server, page services, page servers: A top level or second level service. Page services typically have JavaScript and can interact with users. There can be more than one of each. See data/serverlist.txt for a list of services.

Background service, background server, background services, background servers: has no navigation bar entry, and typically no JavaScript. It lurks in the background. Two are supplied with IntraMine: the Watcher service monitors the file system for changes, and WS handles WebSockets communication. There can be only one running instance of a background service. See data/serverlist.txt for a list of services.

NAS: Network Attached Storage. These are drives accessed over Ethernet, as opposed to locally attached storage which is connected directly to your PC via USB or SATA. IntraMine can index files on NAS, but cannot monitor them for changes, so static source files in a library are fine, but constantly changing source files in a project you're working on would require regular manual re-indexing in order for IntraMine to show up-to-date search results.

Locally attached storage: Storage attached directly to your computer, typically via USB or SATA. Drives on your network are called NAS (Network Attached Storage). IntraMine can index all source and text files on local storage, and also monitor them for changes and re-index.

Strawberry Perl: An open source version of Perl for Windows. See "https://strawberryperl.com/" for details. IntraMine uses Strawberry Perl.

Elasticsearch: Arguably the best free search engine. IntraMine uses Elasticsearch for indexing source and text files, and searching them. It's a bit huge, details can be found at "https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/".

Gloss: IntraMine's Markdown variant, minimal memorable markup designed for intranet use. You can use it fully in text files and use FLASH links in source files, as described in "Gloss.html". Gloss can also be used in glossary definitions which show in any text or source file, see "Glossary popups.html" for glossary usage.

A sample table (see "Gloss.html#Tables" for details)
TABLE Gloss support in various contexts
Feature					IntraMine Viewer, text	Viewer, source		Glossary popups		ToDo
Bold, italic, code		Yes						No					Yes					Yes
FLASH links			Yes (full support)		Yes					"Quotes needed"		"Quotes" and full path needed
Image hovers			Yes						Yes					No (inlined)		"Quotes" and full path needed
Tables					Yes						No					Yes					Yes (use tab or \t to separate cells)
Lists					Yes						No					Yes					Yes
CODE blocks				Yes						No					No					No
(A TABLE ends when there's a line with no tab.)
Quotes can be single or double, eg "Gloss.html" or 'Gloss.html'.
IntraMine's Editor fully supports FLASH links, image hovers, and glossary popups, but otherwise shows Gloss markup as typed.
You can also have
1. Numbered lists
1.2 with subitems, up to 99.99
 - bulleted lists
  -- with subitems too
**Bold**, *italic*, and *!*/* Code snippets */ int x = 42;*!*.
Images will be shown inline, eg "button1.png" "globe.gif" "favicon-32x32.png"

:)

Image hover, hover image, hover images, image hovers: In IntraMine's file views and under the Files page, if you pause your cursor over a linked image name a view of the image will pop up. It goes away when you move your mouse away. You can tell if an image is linked, it has little yellow hummingbirds around it.

Viewer: IntraMine's read-only file viewer service, intramine_viewer.pl. The Viewer is used to show files when an ordinary link is clicked in Search page results, on the Files page, or any file link in a view. The Viewer puts in headings, FLASH links, syntax highlighting for source files, tables and lists etc for source and text files. Currently a table of contents is supported for .txt, Perl, Pod, C / C++, Go, JavaScript, CSS, Clojure, Erlang, OCaml, PHP, Python, Ruby, TypeScript, Rust, Java, C#, VBScript(.vb), VB.NET(.vbs), Haskell, Julia, Fortran, COBOL. For more see "Viewer.html".

Editor: by default IntraMine's built-in Editor. CodeMirror-based, it has standard editing commands and implements FLASH links for local files and web URLs, as well as image hovers and glossary popups. When a file is saved using the Editor, any Viewer display of the file will refresh instantly. To invoke the Editor, click on a "pencil" icon "edit1.png" next to a link in Search results or the Files page or within a Viewer display, or click the "Edit" button at the top of any Viewer display of a file, or click on the right side of a FLASH link (you'll see "EDIT" in small print when you place your cursor over the right end). In IntraMine's Editor the edit link is a purple rectangle at the end of the link, like so -  "editorlink.png". For more see "Editor.html".

Partial path, file specifier, link specifier, link specifiers, file specifiers: For IntraMine's FLASH links, a partial path always includes the file name, and includes zero or more directories that are in its full path. Directories can be skipped, and can be out of order. Drive letter is also optional (but must of course be first if present).

For example, "project51/Cpp/main.cpp" would be a partial path for "P꞉/Cpp/OtherProjects/Project51/src/main.cpp". Under the right circumstances, it could uniquely identify the main.cpp wanted for linking.

Sufficient path: For IntraMine's FLASH links, a sufficient path always includes the file name, and includes zero or more directories that are in its full path. Directories can be skipped, and can be out of order. Drive letter is also optional (but must of course be first if present).

For example, "project51/Cpp/main.cpp" would be a sufficient path for "P꞉/Cpp/OtherProjects/Project51/src/main.cpp". Under the right circumstances, it could uniquely identify the main.cpp wanted for linking.

Run as administrator: You can get a command prompt (console window) by putting a shortcut to "C:/Windows/System32/cmd.exe" on your desktop.

For a single run, right-click on the shortcut and select "Run as administrator".

And you can set it to always "Run as administrator" by right-clicking on the shortcut for Properties, and then clicking on the "Run as administrator" checkbox under the Shortcut tab's Advanced... button.

Map network drive: Open a File Explorer window, click on "This PC" on the left, and then select "Map network drive" at the top. Enter the \\\\host-name\\share-name you want to map, and then select a drive letter to map it to on the PC you're sitting at. Whether or not you'll want to reconnect using a different account is up to you, depending on how you've set things up.

Autolinks, automatic links, automatic linking, autolinking, FLASH link, FLASH links, FLASH linking: when you type a "file specifier" such as qtcpserver.cpp in a text or source file, IntraMine links it to the instance that's closest to where you're typing, based on directory hops up and down to go from one to the other. If needed, you can add some directory names or a drive letter to pin down the file you want, but mostly that's not necessary. You can also link to headings within other files, such as "Gloss.txt#Gloss vs MultiMarkdown tables" (for heading links, quotes are recommended though not required).

See "Gloss.html" and "Linker.html" in IntraMine's Documentation folder for more details and some examples. And autolinking_demo.pl at the top level of your IntraMine folder for a running example of the FLASH link algorithm.

FLASH is short for Fast Local Automatic Source and text Hyperlinks. And yes, it does encourage "FLASH links" which suffers from RAS syndrome. I'll fix that when we all stop saying "PIN number."

Linker: IntraMine's hyperlink service, implementing FLASH links in particular. Also glossary popups. For more see "Linker.html".

Server-Sent Events: (SSE for short) basically, a web page subscribes to a service for specific events, and the service publishes messages to the subscribed pages. IntraMine used to use these, but now WebSockets are used instead.

Command prompt: The command prompt window

"prompt.png"

The flashing insertion point in the window that comes up when you run C:/Windows/System32/cmd.exe or PowerShell.

Console window: The window you can type commands in when you run "C:/Windows/System32/cmd.exe". To make life easier, once you've found it put a shortcut to it on your desktop. You can have two shortcuts, and set one of them to always "Run as administrator" (to do that, right-click and then Properties->Shortcut->Advanced... and check "Run as administrator").

Navigation bar: "topnav.png".

Status page: "2020-02-27 22_40_46-Status.png".

Context aware, context-aware: IntraMine will automatically put links in your source and text files where files are mentioned. If a file name such as "main.cpp" is used for many files, we need some way to pin down which "main.cpp" is meant. IntraMine does this in two ways: you can provide enough of a sufficient path leading up to the file, such as "project51/src/main.pp", that only one indexed file matches that sufficient path; or, if you mean the main.cpp that's "closest" to the file where you've mentioned it, then that's the one IntraMine will pick by default, and only the file name is needed.

"Closest" uses the folder notion of distance, where a step up to a parent folder or a step down into a child folder counts as one step.

If you're writing in project51/docs/Scrum notes Dec 1 2019.txt, for example, and you mention main.cpp, then IntraMine will pick project51/src/main.cpp if that is indeed the "closest" instance of main.cpp, at only two steps away (up from docs to project51, then down into src).

For more, see "FLASH Links.txt".

gloss2html.pl: A Perl program supplied with IntraMine that converts .txt files to completely self-contained moderately attractive HTML files, applying Gloss (with some restrictions on linking). Converted files can be copied to any folder, emailed, etc, and viewed using any browser.

You can convert one file, or a whole folder. Images can be of the "pop up on hover" sort, or inlined in the text. If you supply a glossary.txt file, popup hints will appear for any glossary item mentions in your converted files.

There are the usual Gloss features. If you click on a word, it will be highlighted throughout the document; there's an auto-scrolling table of contents down the left; mentions of other section titles in a document become links if placed in double quotes; mentions of other documents in the folder being converted become links (quotes are also required for links); and there are tables, headings, lists etc. See "Gloss.html" and gloss2html.pl top comments for more.

WebSockets: like HTTP, but it allows two-way communications, and easy communications between web clients.

CTRL+C: "tenor.gif".

Referencing file: the source or text file where you're typing, and want to have a link to a target file. What you type as shorthand for the target file's full path is the "link specifier". The path to the directory holding the referencing file is the "context directory".

Context directory: the path to the directory holding a referencing file. Eg "p:/projects/project51/docs" or "p:/projects/project99/src".

Glossary popup, glossary popups: for general use with IntraMine, glossary popup definitions are contained in any files called "glossary_master.txt" as found in any folder listed in your data/search_directories.txt file. See the glossary_master.txt file at the top of your IntraMine folder for an example. Glossary terms in all source and text files displayed with IntraMine's Viewer will have a dotted underline, and pausing your mouse over the term will show the definition. Popups support rich styling such as bold, italic, FLASH links, and images. For more see "Glossary popups.html".

A separate glossary is available for use with gloss2html.pl. It should be called "glossary.txt" and placed at the top level of any folder containing text files that you want to convert to standalone HTML using gloss2html. For details see "gloss2html.pl for standalone Gloss files.html".

Shortcut on your desktop: To make a shortcut to any file, in a Windows File Explorer view hold down the Shift and Ctrl keys and drag the file to your desktop, or wherever you want the shortcut.

Watcher, FILEWATCHER: the name for intramine_filewatcher.pl, a BACKGROUND service that monitors directories for changes based on your directory list in data/search_directories.txt. It checks in regularly with the log from File Watcher Utilities, and also runs and listens to bats/foldermonitore.ps1, which pushes change notifications more quickly.

Reindex service: the Reindex page has two buttons, to edit your list of directories to index and monitor, and to completely rebuild your search index. For details see "Reindex.html".

Reserved service, reserved services, reserved server, reserved servers: A reserved server (or service) has a port number reserved for it when IntraMine starts, but is not initially started. To make a reserved server, set its Count field to 0 in data/serverlist.txt. To start one, use the "Add one page server" menu on the Status page. Once started if will appear under the "Page servers" list on the Status page, and have an entry in the top navigation bar if appropriate. A typical serverlist entry for a reserved server looks like
0	Reindex				Reindex		intramine_reindex.pl
(note there are tabs between the fields)

Zombie: reserved servers are sometimes called "zombie" servers in the documentation. A reserved server (or service) has a port number reserved for it when IntraMine starts, but is not initially started.
