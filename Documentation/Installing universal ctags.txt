Installing universal ctags.txt
==============================
IntraMine uses ctags to identify functions and classes etc in source files, in order to make entries for those in the file's table of contents.

Here's how to install universal ctags.

1. Visit https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags-win32/releases
2. Click on the big blue name of the version you want, typically the latest version right at the top of the list on that page (eg ctags0.png).
3. Click on the link to the zip file for the x64 non-debug version (eg the second entry in ctags1.png).
4. Unzip, to get a folder named something like "ctags-2019-01-18_5a2b65f8-x64". Inside, you should see "docs" and "license" etc subfolders at the top level.
5. Move or copy that folder to a place on your local storage, not buried too deeply. I put mine at "C:\ctags-2019-01-18_5a2b65f8-x64".
6. Looking in your IntraMine folder, open data/intramine_config.txt and update the entry for CTAGS_DIR. roughly around line 138,
---
CTAGS_DIR	C:/ctags-2019-01-18_5a2b65f8-x64
---
with the location of your own ctags folder.

If you're updating ctags rather than doing the initial install, you'll need to restart IntraMine in order for the changes to take effect.
