SSE
======

**OBSOLETE**

As of August 2021 IntraMine **no longer uses Server-Sent Events**. WebSockets are used instead. On or around line 614 of intramine_main.pl you'll find that the intramine_SSE.pl is specifically prevented from running.

If you have written anything that depends on SSE you can re-enable the SSE server by:
 - making a copy of intramine_SSE.pl, at the top of your IntraMine folder
 - changing the copy's name to anything you like, such as intramine_MY_SSE.pl
 - updating the corresponding program name in your data/serverlist.txt file
 - and then of course restarting IntraMine.

However, if you are using Server-Sent Events, I urge you to read the new "WS.txt" doc which describes how to use WebSockets in IntraMine.

Server-Sent Events have been dropped because they can handle only six connections per browser per domain, and that's just not enough because all of IntraMine counts as a single domain.

Original doc follows.


SSE is a background service that serves as IntraMine's registration and distribution center for Server-Sent Events.

Perl main files:
 - intramine_SSE.pl
 - swarmserver.pm

SSE generates no HTML views and has no JavaScript. It just remembers all web pages that have registered to receive Server-Sent Events, keeps sockets open for them, and handles broadcasting the events as they happen.

A typical Server-Sent Event sequence
====================================
Here's the sequence for the ToDo page. What users see is that if anyone changes the ToDo page, all other views of the page refresh in a fraction of a second.

When someone changes the ToDo items, Sever-Sent Events are used to notify all open browser views of the ToDo page that something has changed, and the pages respond by asking for a refresh from the ToDo server.

1. New browser view of ToDo: todoEvents.js#getSSEPortAndRequestEvents() registers a request to receive "todochanged" events from SSE, and if that succeeds then todoEvents.js#requestSSE() adds an event listener for "todochanged" events.
2. swarmserver.pm#Respond() notices that it has received an SSE registration request, sets aside a socket for use by the client, and SendInitialSSEResponseToOneClient() reports back to the ToDo client that all is fine.
3. User changes the ToDo page (Save or drag).
4. todoGetPutData.js#putData() sends ToDo page data to intramine_SSE.pl#PutData() on the back end for saving.
5. PutData() calls swarmserver.pm#BroadcastSSE("todochanged"). We're still in the ToDo server at this point.
6. BroadcastSSE() calls RequestBroadcast() of "todochanged" message to SSE
7. The swarmserver.pm#RequestBroadcast() being called is the one associated with the ToDo server, and it doesn't know how to reach other servers. So it sends the message back to the Main server (intramine_main.pl), which does know how to reach all other IntraMine servers.
8. #intramine_main.plBroadcastSignal() sends the "todochanged" signal to the SSE server (Main knows the port numbers associated with all Short names such as SSE).
9. intramine_SSE.pl#HandleBroadcastRequest() receives the request, and calls swarmserver.pm#SendEventToClients().
10. SendEventToClients(), associated here with the SSE server, sends out the event message to all clients that have registered with it.
11. The event listener added in step 1 receives the "todochanged" event, and calls todoGetPutData.js#getToDoData(), which refreshes the browser view of the ToDo data. This happens for all ToDo views, since they have all registered to receive Server-Sent Events.

API
========
SSE request handling is a small part of the overall handling of Server-Sent Events. Here's the signal handling, but for an overview of the entire process see above.

Forward an activity event
======================
**Action**: on receiving a "signal=anything" from Main, forward it to all clients that have registered for events. It's up to the client to handle or ignore the event
**Request**: /?signal=[anything, eg todochanged]
**Response**: call swarmserver.pm#SendEventToClients() to send the event message to all clients that have registered with it
**For example**: see above for an example describing "todochanged"
**See also**: intramine_SSE.pl#HandleBroadcastRequest()
