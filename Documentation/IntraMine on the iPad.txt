IntraMine on the iPad
=====================

IntraMine is not "officially" supported on the iPad, whatever that means for a free product, but it's ok for doing a quick search or even a minor edit. For best results, use Safari on as physically large an iPad as possible.

Viewing files on the iPad
=========================
This is for read-only views, mainly brought up by touching a link in Search hits or under the Files tab. They are displayed by IntraMine's Viewer, intramine_file_viewer.pl.

Selecting text: use a double-tap to select a word, or drag to select any amount of text. Single tapping will highlight, but won't select any text.

Image hovers: a brief touch on an image link such as "Strawberry30.png" will open the image in a new tab. Touch and hold to see the popup hover.

Find on page: to invoke the browser's Find command for a page, you'll need to hook up a keyboard. Try the various control keys plus "F", ... one of them should work.

Editing files via the iPad
==========================
IntraMine's built-in Editor will work, but files can't be edited on the iPad using your preferred app. Mainly because I don't know how to do that, or if it's even possible. To configure IntraMine editing see "Configuring IntraMine.txt#Editing".
