Editing documents
=================

As presented in Search hits and IntraMine's views of documents, most links to source and text files have a little pencil icon (edit1.png) beside them. Click the pencil to open the document in either IntraMine's Editor or the editor of your choice. If you disable editing, you won't see the little pencils.

Options
========
You can choose to:
1. Not allow editing
2. Use IntraMine's simple Editor
3. Use your preferred editing app (Eclipse, Visual Studio, notepad++ etc)
And you can make your choice separately for editing while working directly on your IntraMine box, versus using a different (remote) PC. However, all remote PCs must use the same choice, including the same path to the editing app if you pick one (eg C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe). If the preferred editor isn't available on a remote PC then IntraMine's Editor will be used instead.

These options are set by 'ALLOW_LOCAL_EDITING' and entries following it in data/intramine_config.txt, around line 158, as you'll see below.

Editing on your IntraMine PC
============================
To change how editing is handled when you're working on the same PC where IntraMine is installed, open data/intramine_config.txt and scroll down to about line 158, where you'll see 'ALLOW_LOCAL_EDITING' followed by configuration entries (format key <tabs> value) that control "local" editing. The following table shows the possibilities.

TABLE Local editing configuration
Item                     	Description
ALLOW_LOCAL_EDITING		If you want any sort of local editing, set this to 1. Otherwise, 0 disables all local editing.
USE_APP_FOR_EDITING		0 means use IntraMine's built-in simple Editor service, 1 means you will use the application specified in 'LOCAL_OPENER_APP'
LOCAL_OPENER_APP		Set this to one of the keys that follow immediately: 'OPENER_NOTEPADPP' to use notepad++ (which is the default), 'OPENER_ECLIPSE' to use Eclipse, etc.
OPENER_NOTEPADPP etc	Names for specific editors: the value is the path to the editor. You can make up your own entry here and use it. For example you could put OPENER_WHIZBANG followed by one or more tabs and the full path to the Whizbang editor. To use it as your default editor, set USE_APP_FOR_EDITING to 1 and set LOCAL_OPENER_APP to OPENER_WHIZBANG.

**IMPORTANT** if you choose to use your own preferred editor, check and update the path for it in data/intramine_config.txt. My own path next to OPENER_ECLIPSE for example is C:/javascript-2018-12/eclipse/eclipse.exe, but your path for Eclipse is quite likely different. You only need to update the path for the specific editor that you want to use.

For example, if you want to use Visual Studio Code to edit files, then set:
---
ALLOW_LOCAL_EDITING		1
USE_APP_FOR_EDITING		1
LOCAL_OPENER_APP		OPENER_VISUALSTUDIOCODE
---
and if needed update the path for OPENER_VISUALSTUDIOCODE. By default it's
%LOCALAPPDATA%/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/Code.exe
.

Remote editing
==============
If you're not working on the same PC where IntraMine is installed, you are "remote." Configuration settings are similar to local editing, but some extra steps are required if you want to use your own choice of editing app for remote editing.

Here are the configuration settings that govern remote editing, around line 182 in data/intramine_config.txt:
TABLE
Item                      	Description
ALLOW_REMOTE_EDITING		1 if you want to allow any sort of remote editing, 0 to disable.
USE_APP_FOR_REMOTE_EDITING	0 means use IntraMine's built-in simple Editor service, 1 means you will use the application specified in 'REMOTE_OPENER_APP' - but see the following section if you set it to 1.
REMOTE_OPENER_APP			Set this to one of the keys that follow immediately, REMOTE_OPENER_ECLIPSE etc.
REMOTE_OPENER_ECLIPSE etc	These are names for specific editors, enter one of them as the value for REMOTE_OPENER_APP if you have set USE_APP_FOR_REMOTE_EDITING to 1. You can make up your own entry if your wanted editor isn't on the list. For example to use C:/apps/whizbang/whiz.exe as your preferred remote editor make a new entry in data/intramine_config.txt consisting of "WHIZBANG<one or more tabs>C:/apps/whizbang/whiz.exe" and set the value of REMOTE_OPENER_APP to WHIZBANG. 

**IMPORTANT** if you choose to use your own preferred editor, check and update the path for it in data/intramine_config.txt. This should be the path on the *remote* PC, not the path on your IntraMine PC. And because you can set only one path, if you have more than one remote PC then the path to the preferred editor needs to be the same on all of them in order for remote editing to work on all of them.

If your preferred editor path in intramine_config.txt contains "username", replace that with your actual user name on the remote PC. As shipped, REMOTE_OPENER_VISUALSTUDIOCODE and REMOTE_OPENER_ATOM both have "username" in the path.
NOTE type whoami at a command prompt to see your user name.

For example, if you want to use Atom as the editor invoked by IntraMine on your remote PC, and your user name is barney, then set:
---
ALLOW_REMOTE_EDITING		1
USE_APP_FOR_REMOTE_EDITING	1
REMOTE_OPENER_APP			REMOTE_OPENER_ATOM
REMOTE_OPENER_ATOM			C:/Users/barney/AppData/Local/atom/atom.exe
---

Remote editing with your preferred app
======================================
If you've set USE_APP_FOR_REMOTE_EDITING to 1 and selected an editor for your REMOTE_OPENER_APP, there are just a few more steps before you're ready to click a pencil icon and have the file open in your preferred editor. In sum, you'll want to:
1. Share the source folders on your IntraMine PC, so your remote PC can get at them
2. Make an entry in intramine_config.txt for each shared folder
3. Use the shared folders on your remote PC
4. Copy data/Start-Editing.ps1 to your remote PC, and set a port number and path to your editor at the top of the script
5. Unblock Start-Editing.ps1, and punch a hole in your firewall on the remote PC 
6. Run Start-Editing.ps1 each time before you start editing on your remote PC.

Remote editing works best if the folders being shared from your IntraMine PC have also been indexed, since files must be indexed in order for autolinking to work fully. That way, partial paths presented by IntraMine's Viewer will have links. Without indexing, a file mention will need to be a full path to get a link.

Let's take those six steps one at a time.

1. Share the source folders on your IntraMine PC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose you have a folder "P:\Qt" on your IntraMine PC that you want your remote PC to be able to access for editing via IntraMine.

First, it helps to have an account with administrative rights that's different from your login account on your IntraMine PC. This reduces security risks ever so slightly. As our example I'll assume you've created an account with admin rights called "Remote" with password "A1$" (I'm sure you can come up with a better one) on your IntraMine PC.

(To create a new account:
Settings -> Accounts -> Family & other users -> Other users -> Add someone else to this PC)

At a command prompt on your IntraMine PC, enter
---
net share wsqt=P:/Qt /grant:Remote,FULL
---
to share the P:/Qt folder under the share-name "wsqt", accessible only under the "Remote" account.

Share all the folders you want to reach on your remote PC in the same way, varying the share-name ("wsqt") and IntraMine PC folder ("P:/Qt") as you go.

2. Make an entry in intramine_config.txt for each shared folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IntraMine needs to be able to translate an IntraMine PC link path such as "P:/Qt/subfolder/afile.cpp" into a remote path such as "\\desktop-47a\wsqt\subfolder\afile.cpp" in order to access the file remotely. To this end, make an entry in intramine_config.txt that consists of the IntraMine PC folder path being shared as key, and \\host-name\share-name as value. For example, if your IntraMine PC host-name is desktop-47a then the entry in intramine_config.txt for the "P:/Qt" net share done just above would be
---
P:/Qt			\\desktop-47a\wsqt
---
To see your host-name, type whoami at a command prompt. You'll see your host-name\user-name.

Repeat for all folders you're sharing.

3. Use the shared folders on your remote PC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Armed with your list of shared folders, it's time to go to your remote PC and "net use" them. For this step you'll need the host-name of your IntraMine PC, the share-names of your shared folders, and the name and password for your admin account on your IntraMine PC. You'll also need to pick a drive letter for each shared folder.

Start up a command window (cmd or PowerShell). Using wsqt (mapped to "Q:") and other example details from above, the "net use" line to use is
---
START /wait net use Q: \\desktop-47a\wsqt /user:Remote A1$ /persistent:Yes
---
Repeat for each shared folder, varying the share-name ("wsqt") and drive letter ("Q").

4. Copy data/Start-Editing.ps1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open data/Start-Editing.ps1. Around line 20 you'll see
---
$EDITORPATH =  = "C:/eclipse/eclipse/eclipse.exe"
---
Change the path to your preferred edit app on your remote PC.

On line 21,
---
$EDITORPORT = "43124"
---
this port number needs to be the same as the value for INTRAMINE_FIRST_SWARM_SERVER_PORT in data/intramine_config.txt. If you changed that value, then update $EDITORPORT as well. (Sorry I didn't come up with a way to do that for you.)

Save that, it will be your "master" of Start-Editing.ps1 for copying to other PC's.

Copy your altered version of Start-Editing.ps1 to your remote PC. You can put it anywhere you like, just remember where it is. I put mine at C:\PS\Start-Editing.ps1.

5. Unblock Start-Editing.ps1, and punch a hole in your firewall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Right-click on your remote Start-Editing.ps1 and select "Unblock" if you see it.

Configure a firewall exception to allow access to the chosen port:
At a cmd prompt on the remote PC, started with "Run as administrator", enter
---
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Start-Editing" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=43124
---
The name is arbitrary, localport should again be the same as "$EDITORPORT".

If you no longer want this server later, you can remove the firewall rule by name with, e.g.
---
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Start-Editing"
---

6. Run Start-Editing.ps1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you want to have IntraMine use your preferred editor on your remote PC:
 - if your preferred editor is running, quit it, unless you already started it using Run as administrator (which is what Start-Editing.ps1 will do)
 - open a PowerShell window, using **Run as administrator**
2020-05-03 17_17_04-NVIDIA GeForce Overlay.png
 - enter the path to your remote copy of **Start-Editing.ps1** (for example C:\PS\Start-Editing.ps1) and press Enter.
That will start your editor with elevated privileges (Run as administrator), and then start a service that handles passing edit requests from IntraMine to your editor.

For ways to run PowerShell as an administrator, see
https://danielengberg.com/how-to-run-powershell-as-an-administrator

To stop Start-Editing.ps1 (which is running that service just mentioned), return to your PowerShell window and type CTRL+C. Note that won't stop your editor.

You can also stop Start-Editing.ps1 with
http://localhost:43124/?app=quit
where "43124" is the same as the value for $EDITORPORT at the top of Start-Editing.ps1. This also won't stop your editor.

A remote edit example
---------------------
Let's set things up so that when using a remote PC a click on an edit "pencil" icon opens the file using a specific editing app on the remote PC. Note the file being edited stays on the IntraMine PC. I'll try to make this complete, no assumptions.
TABLE Specific details for the example
What									Example value
IntraMine edit port		43124 ("INTRAMINE_FIRST_SWARM_SERVER_PORT" in intramine_config.txt)
IntraMine PC host-name					WORKSTATION1
Remote PC host-name						REMOTE1
IntraMine PC Admin account user/pwd		GabAdmin/1234M$M
Preferred editor (on remote)			REMOTE_OPENER_ATOM
Default value of REMOTE_OPENER_ATOM		C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/atom/atom.exe
Name of user logged in on remote PC		Gab2
Updated value of REMOTE_OPENER_ATOM		C:/Users/Gab2/AppData/Local/atom/atom.exe
Folder on IntraMine PC					P:/Projects
Share-name for P:/Projects				wsprojects
Drive for mapping on remote				Q

Assumptions:
 - an Admin account named "GabAdmin" with password "1234M$M" has been set up on the IntraMine PC, using Settings -> Accounts -> Family & other users -> Other users -> Add someone else to this PC. This is an account on your IntraMine PC and is distinct from the "Gab2" account mentioned below, which is the account used to log in to the remote PC.
 - IntraMine has been installed, and a first index built, with P:\Projects as one of the indexed folders.

1. On your IntraMine PC, share the folder of interest (at a command prompt, note Run as administrator is not needed):
 net share wsprojects=P:/Projects /grant:GabAdmin,FULL
1.1 In IntraMine's data/intramine_config.txt around line 208 where you see "Mappings for use by remote PCs" make a mapping entry for the shared folder:
 P:/Projects			\\WORKSTATION1\wsprojects
2. On your remote PC, use the shared folder (type this at a command prompt, again Run as administrator is not needed):
 net use Q: \\WORKSTATION1\wsprojects /user:GabAdmin 1234M$M /persistent:Yes
 or
 START /wait net use Q: \\WORKSTATION1\wsprojects /user:GabAdmin 1234M$M /persistent:Yes
 to wait until the mapping is complete.
3. In IntraMine's data/intramine_config.txt around line 182, set:
3.1 ALLOW_REMOTE_EDITING	1
3.2 USE_APP_FOR_REMOTE_EDITING	1
3.3 REMOTE_OPENER_APP	REMOTE_OPENER_ATOM
3.4 REMOTE_OPENER_ATOM	C:/Users/Gab2/AppData/Local/atom/atom.exe
 (note "Gab2", the name of the user on the remote PC, has been substituted for "username").
3.5 Restart IntraMine, so it picks up those configuration changes just made.
4. Open IntraMine's data/Start-Editing.ps1, change the value on line 20 for $EDITORPATH to "C:/Users/Gab2/AppData/Local/atom/atom.exe", and verify that "$EDITORPORT" on line 21 has 43124.
4.1 Copy Start-Editing.ps1 to your remote PC. You can save it anywhere, let's assume you save it to "C:\PS\Start-Editing.ps1".
4.2 Right-click on your remote "C:\PS\Start-Editing.ps1" and select "Unblock" if you see it.
4.3 At a cmd prompt on the remote PC, started with "Run as administrator", enter:
 netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="IntraMine-Remote" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=43124
5. Start a PowerShell prompt using Run as administrator, type "C:\PS\Start-Editing.ps1" and press Enter.
6. Now, on the remote PC, bring up a link to any file in the P:\Projects folder that lives on your IntraMine PC, using IntraMine's Search or Files page. Click on the yellow pencil edit icon to the right of the file name, and the file will open in Atom.

iPad editing
============
The iPad is "special" of course (isn't it always) and only no editing or use of IntraMine's simple Editor is possible. For starters, I don't even know how I would specify an app to use on the iPad. So set ALLOW_REMOTE_EDITING to 1 if you want to allow remote editing, including the iPad, and the iPad will always use IntraMine's Editor if so. The contorted English there reflects my feelings about the iPad.
