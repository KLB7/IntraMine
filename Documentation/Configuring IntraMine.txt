Configuring IntraMine
=====================

Basic configuration
===================
Most of IntraMine's configuration options are discussed where they naturally come up. And all of the values in data/intramine_config.txt, IntraMine's main configuration file, are described in that file where they are defined. If you sadly suffer from "compelled to read the entire manual" syndrome, as I do, then you might want to skim through data/intramine_config.txt to see what's available. With the passage of time IntraMine has accumulated some additional configuration files called intramine_config_N.txt where N is an integer. Each has just a few values, typically one or two. You'll find links to all of the configuration files on the Status page. And finally, each service can have its own config file. The locations is the data/ folder, and the naming convention is "Shortname_config.txt", for example DBX_config.txt.

Here we'll mostly go the other way, with a guide to finding config values to make specific things happen. And a brief chat about adding your own configuration values if you're writing your own IntraMine service.

Configuration value files
=========================
IntraMine's configuration values can be found (within your IntraMine folder) in
TABLE IntraMine configuration value files
File						In brief
data/intramine_config.txt	port numbers, file and folder names etc
data/intramine_config_N.txt	miscellaneous constants added after initial release
data/serverlist.txt			services to run: Perl program name, how many of each, etc
data/search_directories.txt	directories to index/monitor with Elasticsearch

Per-service configuration
========================
To get started creating your own IntraMine server, see "Writing your own IntraMine server.txt".

Each IntraMine service (including ones you might write) can have its own specific configuration file. To create such a file for a new service you're writing:
 - note the Short name you've assigned to the service, eg "DBX". The master list of Short names is in data/serverlist.txt
 - create a file in IntraMine's data/ folder called "SHORT_config.txt", where "SHORT" is the short name of the service, eg DBX_config.txt
 - put your config values in there using the format Key <one or more tabs> value, eg 
DBEGPATH	data/dbeg.db
 - the config values will be loaded for your service when you call SSInitialize() near the top of your program.
 - you can retrieve values using the subs in intramine_config.pm (these will be available if you put "use swarmserver;" near the top of your program).
 
TABLE How to retrieve configuration values using subs in intramine_config.pm
To retrieve					Call		Eg
A string					CVal()		my $mainPort = CVal('INTRAMINE_MAIN_PORT');
A full path from partial	FullDirectoryPath()	my $dbPath = FullDirectoryPath('DBEGPATH');

intramine_config.pm#FullDirectoryPath() expects the named partial path to go from the top of your IntraMine folder, wherever it is, down to the file you want. For example, consider the 
DBEGPATH	data/dbeg.db
entry in DBX_config.txt. My IntraMine folder is at C:/perlprogs/mine/. Calling
*!*my $dbPath = FullDirectoryPath('DBEGPATH');*!*
results in *!*$dbPath == 'C:/perlprogs/mine/' . 'data/dbeg.db';*!*
ie *!*$dbPath == 'C:/perlprogs/mine/data/dbeg.db';*!*

intramine_config.pm#CVal() retrieves the string associated with a name, for example intramine_config.txt has
TOTAL_SWARM_PORTS_TO_MONITOR	48
by default, so
CVal('TOTAL_SWARM_PORTS_TO_MONITOR') will return '48'. And Perl nicely treats strings as numbers with only the need for an occasional "plus zero" (see intramine_main.pl#AddAllListeners() for an example).
