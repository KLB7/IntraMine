This is the "Boiler plate" example server. The point isn't to do something interesting, but rather to give you a template from which you can write your own IntraMine servers. It shows a server-generated view of some data, but has no controls. For a more interesting example with create/read/update/delete of some data, please see "DBX.txt".

Bp shows a static view of the arguments that ThePage() receives in its $formH hash when it is called to display a web page.

Main Perl file: intramine_boilerplate.pl
Main JavaScript file:  boilerplateDemo.js

For a guide to writing your own IntraMine server, please see "Writing your own IntraMine server.txt", and apologies if you came here expecting that.

There is no API.
