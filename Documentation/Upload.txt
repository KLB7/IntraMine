Upload
========
Main file: intramine_uploader.pl.

This server uploads files to the IntraMine PC from anywhere on your LAN. It can overwrite any file on your IntraMine PC that's not read-only, and so should only be used if your LAN is secure and "matters of internal security" will not be an issue.

To upload a file
================
1. Click on "Choose File" and select your file
2. Type in a specific directory on your IntraMine PC in the "Server Directory:" box, or else the "C:/temp/" directory will be used
3. Click Upload and the file will be copied to your IntraMine PC.
4. If the file already exists, you will be asked if you want to overwrite it.
