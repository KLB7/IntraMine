IntraMine initial install
=========================

There are a few steps to getting IntraMine up and running, but the first steps as described below consist of putting your IntraMine folder somewhere appropriate, installing Strawberry Perl, and installing some modules for Strawberry Perl that IntraMine needs.

IntraMine is available at
https://github.com/KLB7/IntraMine

You can clone it, or download a zip.

Moving and renaming your IntraMine folder
=========================================
If you've downloaded a zip file for IntraMine rather than cloning it, and unzipped it somewhere, take a look inside the unzipped folder and you'll see a subfolder called "IntraMine". Copy or move that "IntraMine" subfolder to anywhere you want on your local storage (C: drive is fine, just not a NAS drive), preferably near or at the top of a drive, so paths to files within your IntraMine folder don't become excessively long. You can rename your new main "IntraMine" folder if you like, that won't bother anything.

If you cloned IntraMine, wherever it ended up is ok, no need to move or rename it.

IMPORTANT Make your own data folder
===========================
---
Don't miss this step!
---
If you're installing IntraMine at a location for the **first time**:
1. In your IntraMine folder, locate the '_copy_and_rename_to_data' folder.
2. Make a copy of it at the same level (select, Copy, Paste).
3. Rename the copy to 'data'.

This new data/ folder is your own copy of IntraMine's configuration data. The .gitignore file at the top of the IntraMine folder contains
---
data/
---
which will skip the data/ folder for staging etc, so you won't have to worry about having your own config values overwritten by an update, or adding noise to a pull request.



Installing Strawberry Perl
==========================
Head off to
---
http://strawberryperl.com/
---
Download the "Recommended version" from the pink box on the right. IntraMine has been tested with Strawberry Perl 5.30.1 and 5.32.1.1 64bit, but a later version should work fine.

(*the pink box is for an earlier version of Perl, 5.32.1.1 64bit is the latest version that's been tested*)

After downloading, run the msi file to install Strawberry Perl.

Verifying Strawberry Perl is installed
======================================
Open a command prompt, and type the usual
---
perl -v
----
If Strawberry Perl has been installed, you'll see some version info. If not, well I don't know what to tell you, it should have worked. Talk to a friend, try again!

Tell Windows what a Perl file is for
=====================================
If you haven't used Perl before on the PC where you just installed Strawberry Perl:
 - right-click on any of the .pl files at the top of your IntraMine folder (eg "codemirror_extensions.pl")
 - pick Properties
 - if needed, change "Opens with:" to "Perl interpreter".

Punch a hole in your firewall
=============================
It's best to allow Perl through the firewall now, rather than waiting for a prompt later - sometimes the prompt can be tardy.

1. Bring up Settings, and search for firewall
2. Select "Allow an app through Windows Firewall"
3. Click "Change settings"
4. Select "Allow another app..."
5. Browse to C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe and add it.

Now you'll want to grab a few modules.

Installing additional Strawberry Perl modules
=============================================

All at once
-------------
Find /bats/install_perl_modules.bat in your new IntraMine folder, and run it at a command prompt. If you don't have a habitual way of bring up a command window, here's one: in the Search box at the left end of your Task Bar, type "cmd" and then select "Command Prompt" from the list that pops up.

And the quickest way to run that .bat file is to find it with File Explorer and then drag it into your Command Prompt window. Press Enter and off it goes.

You can also run it by entering its full path and pressing Enter.

How long will it take? About half an hour depending on the horsepower of you PC and how cranky Windows is on the day.

Kindly note that just before install_perl_modules.bat file finishes it will ask you a question about accepting a licence. Press "y" and Enter to continue. The batch file will then finish within a few seconds.


One by one
------------
If for some reason you don't want to install the needed Perl modules all at once, you can do them one by one.

Installing modules for Strawberry Perl one at a time is nicely straightforward: if you want "X::Y" installed, type "cpan X::Y" at a command prompt. (cpanm is not recommended since it doesn't always stumble past "do you accept the license?" prompt; I had no luck with it.)

cpan can be a bit laconic, so remember patience is a virtue. It's not dead, just thinking hard.

Here's the list of modules to install for IntraMine. To install the modules, copy each line below to a command prompt and press Enter:
---
cpan Search::Elasticsearch
cpan ExportAbove
cpan Win32API::File::Time
cpan Math::SimpleHisto::XS
cpan File::ReadBackwards
cpan IO::Socket::Timeout
cpan HTML::CalendarMonthSimple
cpan Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved
cpan Text::MultiMarkdown
cpan Win32::RunAsAdmin
cpan Text::Unidecode
cpan Selenium::Remote::Driver
cpan Protocol::WebSocket::Client
cpan Net::WebSocket::Server
cpan URI::Encode
cpan Date::Business
---
The last one on the list, Date::Business, will ask you to accept a licence agreement: hit"y" and Enter, and it will finish in a few seconds.

Optional modules
=================
IntraMine includes extract_method.pl, which can be used to extract a chunk of Perl code into a new sub. It can be called from Eclipse and other editors: you copy the code for the new sub, run extract_method.pl, choose whether undeclared variables should be passed in by value or reference or ignored, and then the resulting sub is on your clipboard. See "Other Perl programs.txt#extract_method.pl" for more.

If you want to try it you'll need to install Tk, which is a bit large. To install the Tk modules needed by extract_method.pl, use the line below at a command prompt:
---
cpan Tk::BrowseEntry
---
You can expect the installation of that to proceed with all sorts of neon warnings, mainly due to the authors hot-dogging pointer casts and such.

NOTE as an alternative to the standalone program extract_method.pl, IntraMine includes the "EM" service, an "Extract Method" refactor service for Perl code. EM can be accessed anywhere on your intranet where IntraMine can be reached, unlike the extract_method.pl which can be used only on the computer where it is run. EM also handles Unicode and references better, and does not require the installation of Tk. To use "EM" instead, see "EM.txt".

Verifying module installation
=============================
When it's time to start up IntraMine not long from now at the end of installation, you'll see complaints about any missing modules.

The fix for a missing module is as simple as you might guess: if "X::Y" is missing then run "cpan X::Y" at a command prompt. However, this falls in the "shouldn't happen" category if you've managed to heroically stay the course.
