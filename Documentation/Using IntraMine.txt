Using IntraMine
===============

**NOTE** as of Feb 2025 this document is no longer maintained. It's been split into smaller documents. Please see "contents.txt" for a full list of docs available.

Start and stop IntraMine
========================
You can **start IntraMine** by double-clicking bats\START_INTRAMINE.bat as found in your IntraMine folder. (Note you don't need to use "Run as administrator" to start or stop IntraMine.) You might want to put a shortcut on your desktop.

To **stop IntraMine**, double-click on bats\STOP_INTRAMINE.bat. This is the best way, because each server will finish whatever it might be busy with before quitting. And for this one as well you might want to put a shortcut on your desktop.

I've shortened the names for my own shortcuts to "IM START" and "IM STOP".

For normal use, let IntraMine run 24/7.

Visit IntraMine with your browser
=================================
Go to http://localhost:81/Search (use your main port number, if you decided not to use 81). Or you can go to some other running page such as "ToDo" or "Status", just substitute that for "Search" in the URL.

To visit IntraMine from a different PC, substitute the LAN IP of your IntraMine PC for "localhost". (Run "ipconfig /all" on your IntraMine PC in a command window to discover the Local "IPv4 Address" which will be four sets of three digits, such as 192.168.1.40).

The Navigation Bar
==================
IntraMine puts a top navigation bar on each page, listing top-level page services. A service is top-level if its Page name and Short name are the same, and it's not a BACKGROUND service (see the table just below).

All enabled top-level servers will be listed in the navigation bar, in the order that they appear in data/serverlist.txt.

On the far right end of the navigation bar is a question mark that brings up IntraMine help when clicked. You probably knew that, since this file is part of the help.

Supplied services
=================
Here are the servers supplied with IntraMine. You'll find the master list used by IntraMine in data/serverlist.txt in your IntraMine folder. The individual services are described in their own files, as listed in the "SUPPLIED SERVICES" section of contents.txt.

TABLE All services, with default Count value
Count	Page name			Short name	Program						Option	Docs
1		Search				Search		intramine_search.pl			 Search.txt
2		Search				Viewer		intramine_viewer.pl	 		Viewer.txt
2		Search				Linker		intramine_linker.pl	 		Linker.txt
1		Search				Opener		intramine_open_with.pl	 	Opener.txt
1		Search				Editor		intramine_editor.pl			 Editor.txt
1		Files				Files		intramine_filetree.pl	 	Files.txt
0		Upload				Upload		intramine_uploader.pl	 	Upload.txt
0		Days				Days		intramine_daysserver.pl	 	Other services.txt
0		Events				Events		intramine_eventsserver.pl	 	Other services.txt
0		Cash				Cash		intramine_cashserver.pl	 	Other services.txt
1		ToDo				ToDo		intramine_todolist.pl	 	ToDo.txt
0		Cmd					Cmd			intramine_commandserver.pl	PERSISTENT	Cmd.txt
1		Status				Status		intramine_status.pl	 	Status.txt
1		DBX					DBX			intramine_db_example.pl	 	DBX.txt
1		Bp					Bp			intramine_boilerplate.pl	 	Bp.txt
1		FILEWATCHER			Watcher		intramine_filewatcher.pl	BACKGROUND	FILEWATCHER.txt
0		Chat				Chat		intramine_chat.pl			 	Chat.txt
1		EM					EM			intramine_EM.pl 			EM.txt
0		Reindex				Reindex		intramine_reindex.pl		 	Reindex.txt



The "Count" field controls how many of each server to start.

To disable a server, set its "Count" field to 0 in data/serverlist.txt.

Only one instance of a BACKGROUND service can be run, so the Count values for a service such as FILEWATCHER are basically zero to not run and non-zero to run.

To start, stop, restart or add a service on the fly, use the Status page. Additions and deletions of services done on the fly will not survive a restart of IntraMine, though. To make a permanent change to which services are running, edit the "Count" column in data/serverlist.txt and restart IntraMine. Note PERSISTENT and BACKGROUND service counts can only be adjusted by editing data/serverlist.txt.

A minimal set for search/view/edit
==================================
By default, the Count for both Linker and Viewer services is set to 2. The Viewer is small, so it doesn't matter much, but the Linker does take a bit of memory, needing about 400 MB for every 300,000 files. So if you find you're low on memory, you can free up a bit by setting the Linker Count to 1. The one main drawback of doing so is that the Linker will go out of service for a few seconds if you rename a folder. With two running, the Linkers take turns for maintenance and there is no service interruption.

If you just want to search, view, and edit source and text files, you can disable the ToDo, DBX, and Bp servers. You can also disable the Editor server if you want, or use your own preferred editing app in place of IntraMine's built-in editor, as described in "Editing documents.txt".

Ramping up for many users
=========================
The only services supplied with IntraMine that might experience heavy load are the Linker and Viewer. If you have many users and people notice that it's taking a long time to open or scroll through file views, the cure is to increase the Count field for both the Linker and Viewer in data/serverlist, and of course restart IntraMine.

The Viewer has minor memory needs (under 40 MB), but each Linker needs about 400 MB for every 300,000 files. If people report slow file loading times, that means you could use another Viewer. If links don't fill in immediately when scrolling through a document, that means you could use another Linker. As usual, you can increase the number of Viewer or Linker services running by bumping up the Count field in data/serverlist.txt.

Indexing additional folders
=================================
You can add one or more folders for indexing and monitoring without having to completely rebuild your Elasticsearch index. To do that:
1. Open data/search_directories.txt.
2. Change all of the "Index" entries to 0.
3. Add the new directory paths, and set "Index" for them to 1.
4. Leave the existing "Monitor" entries as-is, and for the new entries: set "Monitor" to 1 if the path is on locally attached storage and you want to pick up on file changes; and set to 0 if the path is on NAS or you're not interested in re-indexing files there that change.
5. Save search_directories.txt, and run **bats/IM_ADD_INDEX.bat**. This will stop IntraMine, add files in the new folders to your Elasticsearch index, and restart IntraMine. Along the way it will also stop the File Watcher service, rebuild its XML config file that tells it which folders to monitor, and restart the File Watcher service.
6. Against the day when you might want to completely rebuild your Elasticsearch index, this would be a good time to revisit data/search_directories.txt and change all the altered "Index" entries back to 1.

However, doing a complete reindex instead doesn't take that long. To do that, add and delete your entries in data/search_directories.txt and then see "Reindex.html".

Adding files to indexed folders
===============================
If it's just say a few hundred files, no worries. But if you want to add thousands and thousands of files to a directory that's already been indexed by Elasticsearch and is being monitored for changes, this can swamp IntraMine's Watcher with changes to the point where it will stop responding for a while, meaning you won't see FLASH link or glossary popup updates until the Watcher churns through the backlog. Be patient, it might take ten minutes, but service will return to normal:)

Installing new Perl modules
===========================
This case is a bit harder for IntraMine to deal with, since there's a strong chance that many many files will be renamed all at once, and that can lead to problems, even a lockup. If you do add a Perl module (with "cpan Some::Module" or equivalent) and IntraMine stops responding for more than a few minutes, then **force IntraMine to quit** with CTRL+C in IntraMine's console window and then follow steps 2 and 3 just below.

Recommended if you're installing new Perl modules:
1. Stop IntraMine, preferably by running bats/STOP_INTRAMINE.bat (double-click it)
2. Install the new Perl modules you want
3. Run bats/IM_INIT_INDEX.bat and wait a few minutes.
At the end, IntraMine will be up and running again.

More to explore
===============

### FLASH links
(Fast Local Automatic Source and text Hyperlinks)
Type just the file name and get the right link: how can that work? IntraMine knows the full paths to all files of interest to you, and when there's more than one matching file it picks the one closest to where you're writing. "Closest" means the the minimum number of directory moves up and down to get from where you're typing to your intended target file. In rare cases where that's not enough you can supply all or part of the path to the target file: the path need not be complete, the directory names need not be in order. In text files and source file comments you don't even need quotes, unless you've included '#' followed by a function or class or header name. Here's one: contents.html.
For the details, see "FLASH Links.txt".

### Glossary popups
Why aren't you using a glossary? Possibly because it's a bit tedious: you see a term you're not sure about, open the glossary, and find it in alphabetical order (maybe), then go back to reading. How about this instead: you see a term, you know it's in the glossary because it has a subtle dotted underline, you pause your mouse over it, and the definition instantly pops up with a mix of styled text, clickable links, images, tables, lists, and a scroll bar if needed. Better, right? All glossary entries are automatically available in all source and text files on your PC or LAN when the file is viewed with IntraMine. Typing up a glossary definition is as easy as putting *term colon definition* in a file called "glossary_master.txt".
For the how-to see "Glossary popups.html", or the top of the "glossary_master.txt" example glossary file at the top of your IntraMine folder.

Here's an admittedly full-throttle example of a glossary definition being viewed:
gloss1.png
*An image of a glossary popup, showing off Gloss for the formatting. Pause your mouse over "Gloss" in the previous sentence and you'll see a real glossary popup.*

### Fast system-wide search
IntraMine uses Elasticsearch (https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch) to provide near-instant search of all your source and text files (which could easily number half a million these days), with index updates in five seconds. Search results show links to matching files, with a bit of context around the first hit in each file to give you a better assessment. You can limit searches by language or directory, but there's no need to do that for speed.
Details are in "Search.html".

### Gloss for markdown
If you like the idea of using some sort of markdown for your internal documents, but want something with very little overhead and memorable syntax that makes things like links and tables as easy as possible, take a look at "Gloss.txt".

### Gloss for standalone HTML
Speaking of Gloss, IntraMine comes with **gloss2html.pl** for converting Gloss-style .txt documents to single-file completely standalone HTML. If you're reading this document after accessing it through IntraMine's "?" help on the navigation bar, then you're seeing such a file.

You get all of Gloss's standard features, but FLASH links are limited to files in the same directory as the file being converted. In particular, glossary popups are supported. You have the option of inlining images rather than having them pop up on a hover.

See "gloss2html.pl for standalone Gloss files.html" if you like the idea of having Markdown styling, FLASH links, a synchronized table of contents, glossary popups etc in your documentation without having to use IntraMine to view the resulting HTML files.

### A truly nice file Viewer
Pause your cursor over Viewer to see a brief overview. Details in Viewer.html.

### A simple but useful Editor
IntraMine's Editor isn't fancy, but it's good enough for editing .txt files. These could be your personal development notes, or a set of documents marked up with Gloss that you'll be sharing with others. If a file is also open in the Viewer then the view will refresh immediately when you save using the Editor, so you can see a fully rendered preview as you work. If you close an Editor tab for a file without saving, when you re-open the file you'll have the option of restoring unsaved changes.

### Write your own IntraMine server
IntraMine takes care of basic issues such as HTTP communications, so you're free to write the interesting parts. See "Writing your own IntraMine server.txt".

### Themes
IntraMine comes with 59 themes that you can apply to the Viewer and Editor. To change your theme, open data/select_theme_here.txt in an editor and follow the instructions at top for selecting your theme.
